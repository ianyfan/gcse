1. Voltage is the electric potential energy per unit charge between two points, and is used up in a circuit
2. The voltage at a point is indicated by calculating the potential difference relative to a 0 V reference using the voltage drops of the components in the circuit
3. Analogue signals continuously vary and digital signals are two-state
