| Type |Function|
|:----:|:------:|
| Push |It causes a temporary change in state whilst physically actuated|
|Toggle|It is manually actuated by a mechanical lever, handle or rocking mechanism|
| Reed |It is a pair of contacts on ferrous metal reeds that is actuated in magnetic field|
|Micro |It is actuated at very high speed by very little physical force but separating the contacts requires significant force in the opposite direction|
| Tilt |It is actuated using a small amount of liquid mercury, or ball bearings, which falls onto the contacts under gravity when the switch is tilted to an appropriate angle|
|Rotary|It is operated by rotation and is often used when more than two positions are needed|
