1. ###Overview

    1. A refugee is a person who is outside their home country because they have either suffered or feared persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, been a member of a persecuted social group or is fleeing war
2. ###Causes

    1. The borders of Afghanistan created by the European empires did not reflect the ethnic divisions there, causing the borders to be fluid & vague as people moved across the borders
    2. Most refugees fled Afghanistan in 4 main waves due to: the Soviet War in the 80s, civil war in the early 90s, Taliban rule in the late 90s and the war in Afghanistan since 2001
    3. Over 60 thousand fleeing Afghans have sought asylum in the UK
