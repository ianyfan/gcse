1. An ageing population creates challenges & opportunities
2. ###Challenges
 1. There is a greater demand on health care since more illness occurs in old age
 2. Other services are required to care for the elderly, such as nursing homes
 3. Taxes must increase to fund this, as well as pensions
 4. Pensions must last longer due to increasing life expectancy

3. ###Opportunities
 1. Younger retired people contribute a great deal to the economy since they are relatively wealthy and have lots of leisure time to spend on travel & recreation, providing jobs in the service sector
 2. Many do voluntary work and some still do paid work and pay taxes
