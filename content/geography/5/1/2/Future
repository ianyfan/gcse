1. There are three models for the projection of future population growth: high, medium and low
2. All predict initial growth
3. High continues this growth, with a possible slight increase in growth rate, to 16 billion by 2100
4. Low predicts overpopulation, with population falling to 6 billion by 2100
5. Medium compromises between the two, predicting growth at a slowing rate, reaching 10 billion by 2100
