1. A population pyramid is a type of bar graph used to show the age & gender structure of a country, city or other area
2. The horizontal axis split into male & female, on the left & right side respectively, and shows the number or proportion of the population
3. The vertical axis shows age categories, usually in 5-year cohorts
4. ###Demographic transition models ![Population pyramid diagrams](/gcse/img/geography/populationpyramids.png)
 1. Each stage of the demographic transition model has a characteristic population pyramid associated with it
 2. Stage 1 pyramids have a very wide base due to their high birth rate, but a concave shape due to their high death rate, especially infant & child mortality, and a very low apex due to a low life expectancy
 3. Stage 2 pyramids have a slightly narrower base due to a decreasing birth rate, straighter sides due to a falling death rates and a higher apex due to a rising life expectancy
 4. Stage 3 pyramids have convex sides and a rapidly narrowing base due to falling birth rates
 5. Stage 4 pyramids have convex sides due to steadily low birth & death rates, with a higher proportion of elderly people due to a high life expectancy
 6. Stage 5 pyramids have a significantly higher proportion of elderly people and a low proportion of children
