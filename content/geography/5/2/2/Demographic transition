1. Countries pass through different stages of population growth as shown in the five stages of the demographic transition model

|Stage|Characteristics|Examples|
|:---:|:--------------|:------:|
|  1  |Death rate is high & fluctuating due to disease, famine, war and a lack of healthcare<br>Birth rate is high & fluctuating due to a lack of birth control<br>This causes little natural change|Remote rainforest tribes in Amazonia & Indonesia<br>The UK before the start of the Industrial Revolution in about 1760|
|  2  |Death rate falls due to improvements in health care and food supply<br>Birth rate remains high<br>This cause natural increase to rise|Afghanistan<br>The UK during the Industrial Revolution from around 1760 to 1880|
|  3  |Death rate continues falling but at a slowing rate<br>Birth rate falls due to the availability of birth control and social & economic changes that make it more beneficial to have smaller families<br>This causes natural increase to fall|Most LEDCs<br>The UK between around 1880 & 1940|
|  4  |Death rate is low & fluctuating<br>Birth rate is low & fluctuating, usually according to economic situation<br>This causes little natural change|Most MEDCs<br>The UK after around 1940|
|  5  |Death rate rises due to an ageing population<br>Birth rate falls as it becomes more common to postpone motherhood<br>This causes natural decrease to increase|Japan, Germany, Italy and many eastern European countries|
