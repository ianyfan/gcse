1. ###Fold mountains
 1. Fold mountains are formed at destructive plate boundaries, especially at continental collisions, and are the highest areas on Earth
 2. When plates collide or undergoes subduction, it buckles and the sedimentary strata at the boundary folds upwards in what are known as orogenic belts
 3. Folding downwards forms a syncline; folding upwards forms an anticline
 4. The peaks of anticlines erode away as it ages

2. ###Ocean trenches
 1. Ocean trenches are formed at destructive plate margins where subduction occurs, and are the deepest areas on Earth
 2. There are 50,000 km of destructive plate boundary, mostly around the Pacific Ocean, but also in the Indian Ocean, with small segments in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea
