1. ###Characteristics
 1. A supervolcanoes is a volcano capable of producing a volcanic eruption with an ejecta volume greater than 1000 km^^2^^
 2. They are formed when magma rises from a hotspot but is unable to break through the crust, causing the pressure to build up in a growing magma pool until the crust is unable to contain it
 3. Supervolcanoes typically do not have cones; instead, they have calderas, which form after large eruptions when the emptied magma chamber is unable to support the volcanic edifice above it, causing it to collapse

2. ###Effects of an eruption: Yellowstone
 1. Destroy 10,000 km^^2^^
 2. Kill 87,000 people
 3. Buildings within 1000 km would be covered with 15 cm of ash
 4. 1 in 3 people affected would die
 5. Ash would reach the UK within 5 days
 6. Global climates would change, crop would fail and many people would die
