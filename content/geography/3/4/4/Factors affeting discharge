1. Discharge goes up with a higher amount of rainfall since the water saturates quicker, causing more water to flow into the river
2. Discharge goes down with a higher temperature since more water is lost by evaporation & transpiration
3. Discharge goes up if previous conditions were wetter since the land is more saturated
4. Discharge goes up with a steeper and less obstructed relief since more surface runoff occures than infiltration
5. Discharge goes down with more permeable rock since more surface runoff occurs than infiltration
6. Discharge goes up with land use, generally in the form of deforestation or urbanisation, since deforestation means there is less interception and urbanisation makes the surface impermeable, causing more surface runoff and drainage
