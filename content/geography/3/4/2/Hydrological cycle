1. Precipitation is any source of moisture reaching the ground, such as rain, snow and frost
2. Interception is water being prevented from reaching the surface by trees or grass
3. Surface storage is water held on the ground surface, such as puddles
4. Infiltration is water sinking into soil or rock
5. Soil moisture is water held in the soil layer
6. Percolation is water seeping deeper below the surface
7. Groundwater is water stored in the rock
8. Transpiration is water lost through pores in vegetation
9. Evaporation is water lost from the ground or a vegetation surface
10. Surface-runoff, or overland flow, is water flowing on top of the ground
11. Throughflow is water flowing through the soil layer parallel to the surface
12. Groundwater flow is water flowing through the rock layer parallel to the surface
13. Water table is the current upper level of saturated rock or soil where no more water can be absorbed
