1. Floodplains are areas of land adjacent to the river that are formed by meander migration
2. Normally, the river is contained within its banks but during a flood, the river breaks its banks
3. The river deposits its loads with larger material being deposited closer to the banks
4. Over a significant number of floods, the material on the side builds up to form levees and fertile alluvium on the floodplains
