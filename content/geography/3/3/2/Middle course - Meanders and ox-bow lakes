1. ###Meanders
 1. The fastest flow, or thalweg, of a river is round the outer banks
 2. This causes lateral erosion on the outer banks and deposition on the inner banks, where the river has less energy
 3. This forms a river cliff on the outer banks and a slip-off slope on the inner banks
 4. The result is large winding horse-shoe shaped meanders

2. ###Ox-bow lakes
 1. Over a long period of time, meanders become very curved and the neck of the meander becomes narrower
 2. Eventually, the river cuts through the meander neck and preferentially flows through it, cutting off the meander
 3. The result is an ox-bow lake
