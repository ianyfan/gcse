1. The concentric zone model, developed by Ernest Burgess in 1923, is based on the idea that land values in a town or city are proportional to the distance from the centre
2. The central business district, located in the centre of the city, is easily accessible and the main shopping & service area, characterised by high-rise, high-density buildings
3. The inner city, located next to the CBD, was build to house factory workers who worked in the factories, and is characterised by mainly terraced houses in a grid-like pattern
4. The suburbs, located on the outskirts of the city, has higher-quality housing for people who can afford to commute into the city
