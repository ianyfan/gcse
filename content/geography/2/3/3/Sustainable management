1. Over 16 km^^2^^ of forest has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a European Special Area of Conservation, which offers protection under law to its large number of ancient trees, which support a vast variety of flora & fauna
2. For many years, the woodland was managed using pollarding, whereby trees are cut to about shoulder height, from where they then reshoot, thereby producing a supply of wood for future generations; this is above the grazing levels of the animals
3. Management plans provide open space for the public whilst conserving the forest, including:
 1. Maintaining car parks, toilets, footpaths and refreshment facilities for reacreation
 2. Controlling recreation, such as mountain biking
 3. Preserving the herd of fallow deer
 4. Maintaining ponds to prevent them silting up
 5. Preserving ancient earthworks & buildings
