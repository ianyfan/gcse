1. ###Logging
 1. During the 80s, rampant logging on Borneo led to Malaysia becoming the world's largest exporter of tropical wood
 2. Clear felling, whereby all trees are felled in an area, was common and led to the destruction of forest habitats
 3. This reduces biodiversity, threatening endangered species as well as indigenous tribes
 4. In recent years, the main logging practice has been selective logging

2. ###Energy
 1. The $2 billion Bakun Dam project in Sarawak flooded thousands of hectares of rainforest to supply hydroelectric power, mainly for industrialised Peninsula Malaysia
 2. 250 km^^2^^ of virgin rainforest was cut down, causing irreversible ecological damage
 3. 9000 indigenous Kenyan people, mostly subsistence farmers, were relocated and most have not been compensated

3. ###Mining
 1. Areas of rainforest have been cleared to make way for mines and roads
 2. The industry has been largely dominated by tin mining and smelting, but drilling for oil & gas has also begun in Borneo
 3. This has led to pollution of the land & rivers

4. ###Commercial plantations
 1. Malaysia is a major producer of oil palm and rubber
 2. In the early 20th century, forest was cleared to make way for the rubber plantations, but in recent decades, synthetic rubber has led to a steep decline in rubber exports and many plantations have been abandoned or converted to palm oil
 3. During the 70s, large areas of land were converted to palm oil plantations, further incentivised by a 10-year tax break
 4. This has caused a large amount of deforestation in Borneo

5. ###Resettlement
 1. In the past, poor urban dwellers were encouraged to move into the countryside to relieve pressure on cities
 2. This is called transmigration
 3. Between 1960 & 80, an estimated 1500 hectares of forest was felled to accommodate the new settlers, many of whom set up plantations

6. ###Fires
 1. Fires are common in Borneo: some are natural, resulting from lightning, whereas others result from forest clearance or arson
 2. Occasionally, "slash & burn" agriculture, wherein local people clear small areas of land for farmland, results in wildfires
