1. Hard engineering strategies involve the use of technology in order to control rivers
2. A dam is a barrier across the river that prevents the flow of the river, causing water to fill the area behind it and create a reservoir, which can be released or held depending on circumstances such as current and expected rainfall
3. Straightening meanders involve making the river follow a shorter and straighter route, causing it to flow faster so there is less change of it flooding
4. Embankments are raised banks along a river, effectively making them deeper so they can hold more water before flooding
5. Flood walls are build around settlements and important areas that stop the movement of water
6. Storage areas are areas of land where water is pumped from the river to make a temporary lake before being pumped back in after river levels fall
