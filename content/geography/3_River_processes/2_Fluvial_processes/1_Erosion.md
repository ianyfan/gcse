1. Erosion can happen in two directions: vertically & laterally
2. Hydraulic action is weathering caused by not only the sheer force of the water hitting the river beds & banks but also by water forcing & compressing air in cracks & crevices, wearing them away
3. Abrasion is weathering caused by the load carried by the river repeatedly hitting the river beds & banks
4. Attrition is weathering caused by rocks carried by the river hitting each other and breaking
5. Solution is weathering caused by soluble rocks dissolving into the water
