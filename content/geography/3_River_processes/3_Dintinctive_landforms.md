1. ###Upper course - Waterfalls & gorges

    1. When a river flows over hard rock, erosion happens slower than on soft rock downstream
    2. Undercutting occurs when the soft rock is eroded due to splashback, forming a rock shelter
    3. The overhang collapses and the river retreats upstream
    4. A plunge pool develops due to erosion, and the river carves out a steep-sided gorge of recession
2. ###Middle course - Meanders & ox-bow lakes

    1. ####Meanders

        1. The fastest flow, or thalweg, of a river is round the outer banks
        2. This causes lateral erosion on the outer banks and deposition on the inner banks, where the river has less energy
        3. This forms a river cliff on the outer banks and a slip-off slope on the inner banks
        4. The result is large winding horse-shoe shaped meanders
    2. ####Ox-bow lakes

        1. Over a long period of time, meanders become very curved and the neck of the meander becomes narrower
        2. Eventually, the river cuts through the meander neck and preferentially flows through it, cutting off the meander
        3. The result is an ox-bow lake
3. ###Lower course - Floodplains & levees

    1. Floodplains are areas of land adjacent to the river that are formed by meander migration
    2. Normally, the river is contained within its banks but during a flood, the river breaks its banks
    3. The river deposits its loads with larger material being deposited closer to the banks
    4. Over a significant number of floods, the material on the side builds up to form levees and fertile alluvium on the floodplains
