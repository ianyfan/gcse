1. When a river flows over hard rock, erosion happens slower than on soft rock downstream
2. Undercutting occurs when the soft rock is eroded due to splashback, forming a rock shelter
3. The overhang collapses and the river retreats upstream
4. A plunge pool develops due to erosion, and the river carves out a steep-sided gorge of recession
