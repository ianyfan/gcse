1. ###Long profile

    1. The long profile plots the height of a river against its course, which is how far it has flown from its source
    2. Theoretically, the long profile has a steep gradient near the source, giving way to a more gradual slope farther downstream as potential energy is replaced by a larger mass
2. ###Cross profile

    1. A cross profile of a river shows the cross section of the river at a particular point
    2. Cross profiles at different points on the river can be used to show how the river changes as it flows downstream
    3. Generally, the cross profile shows the valley becoming wider and flatter with lower valley sides

    |Property|Upper course|Middle course|Lower course|
    |:------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:----------:|
    |Channel shape|Shallow & narrow|Wider & deeper|Widest & deepest|
    |Erosion direction|Vertical|Some vertical but more lateral|Less erosion: only a little lateral|
    |Erosion type|Hydraulic action, abrasion and attrition|Abrasion & attrition|All erosion much less important|
    |Transportation type|Some traction & saltation at high flow|Suspension mainly but saltation & traction still present|Suspension dominant|
    |Deposition|Large material|Most material|Fine material|
    |Load size|Large|Reduced|Very small, but large amount|
