1. A storm hydrograph shows precipitation, in millimetres, against time as a bar chart and the discharge of a rive, in cumecs, against time as a line graph after the start of a storm
2. The discharge of the river during normal conditions is called the base flow
3. The highest rainfall and discharge are called the peak rainfall and peak discharge respectively, with the time between them called the lag time
4. If the lag time is short, the hydrograph is called a flashy hydrograph
5. If the lag time is long, the hydrograph is called a delayed hydrograph
6. The part showing an increasing discharge to the peak is called the rising limb and the part showing a decreasing discharge after the peak is called the falling limb
