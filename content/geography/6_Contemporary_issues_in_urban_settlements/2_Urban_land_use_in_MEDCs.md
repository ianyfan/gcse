    1. The concentric zone model, developed by Ernest Burgess in 1923, is based on the idea that land values in a town or city are proportional to the distance from the centre
    2. The central business district, or CBD, located in the centre of the city, is easily accessible and is the main shopping & service area, characterised by high-rise, high-density buildings
    3. The inner city, located next to the CBD, was build to house factory workers who worked in the factories, and is characterised by mainly terraced houses in a grid-like pattern
    4. The suburbs, located on the outskirts of the city, has higher-quality housing for people who can afford to commute into the city
2. ###Sector model

    1. The sector model, developed by Homer Hoyt in 1939, adds sectors of similar land uses concentrated in parts of the city, based on the idea that zones expand outward from the CBD along transport routes
