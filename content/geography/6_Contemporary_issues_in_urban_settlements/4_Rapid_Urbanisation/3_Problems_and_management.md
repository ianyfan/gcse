1. ###Air pollution
 1. Rapid urbanisation gives rise to mass industrial production, which emits sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere
 2. This can be managed by developing new technologies that can reduce these emission levels
 3. It can also be managed by switching to cleaner fuel sources, but in places like Chine where 80% of electricity is from coal, this may necessitate the introduction of a carbon tax
 4. Transport should also be managed by limiting the number of cars allowed on the roads and improving public transport

2. ###Water pollution
