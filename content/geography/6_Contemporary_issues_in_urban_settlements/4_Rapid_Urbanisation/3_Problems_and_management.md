1. ###Waste disposal

    1. In poorer countries, industries have not been disposing waste properly, resulting in toxic waste that can affect people's health, exacerbated by poor regulations and lack of planning for environmental problems
    2. This can be managed by properly disposing waste, such as installing solid waste disposal units in households or sending waste to richer countries to dispose of, or recycling & reusing waste, such as fertilisers
2. ###Air pollution

    1. Rapid urbanisation gives rise to mass industrial production, which emits sulfur dioxide & nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere
    2. This can be managed by developing new technologies that can reduce these emission levels
    3. It can also be managed by switching to cleaner fuel sources, but in places like China where 80% of electricity is from coal, this may necessitate the introduction of a carbon tax
    4. Transport should also be managed by limiting the number of cars allowed on the roads and improving public transport
3. ###Water pollution

    1. Water pollution can cause health problems for those who drink or wash with the water, and kill fish, affecting the local economy
    2. This can be managed by introducing water treatment works on the river to improve water quality, such as The Ganga Action Plan on the River Ganges in 1986
