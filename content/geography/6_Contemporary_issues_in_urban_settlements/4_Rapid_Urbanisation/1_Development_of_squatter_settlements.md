1. Urbanisation in LEDCs results in a CBD developing in the centre of the city, but with progressively lower class housing as the distance from the CBD increases
2. This rapid urbanisation has led to the development of squatter settlements on the outskirts of the city due to rural-to-urban migration
3. There is not enough time for the government to accommodate the high numbers of migrants with housing & jobs so people build makeshift homes and, as there are few official jobs available, create their own employment, causing the development of an informal economy
