1. Earthquakes can occur wherever there is a fracture in the Earth's crust, but are mainly concentrated around the plate boundaries
2. They occur when there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation through a fault plane
3. They are caused by stick-slip behaviour between plates due to the asperities along the boundary; the fault locks, but the plates continue to move, increasing the strain until it breaks through the asperity
4. At destructive plate boundaries, the subduction forms reserve faults, which can cause megathrust earthquakes, which are the most powerful earthquakes, with moment magnitudes that can exceed 9.0
5. At conservative plate boundaries are strike-slip faults, which can produce major earthquakes up to moment magnitude 8.0
6. Earthquakes at constructive plate boundaries tend to be less severe since the friction of plates moving apart is less intense
