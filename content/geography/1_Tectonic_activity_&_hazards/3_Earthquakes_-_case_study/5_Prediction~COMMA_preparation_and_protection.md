1. ###Prediction

    1. Monitor earth tremors, like Japan
    2. Observe animal behaviour, although this is viewed sceptically in the west; for example, in 1975, 150 thousand people were saved in Haicheng, China
2. ###Preparation

    1. Preemptive evacuation
    2. Hospitals, emergency services and inhabitants practise for major disasters, including having drills in public buildings and a code of practice
3. ###Protection

    1. Base isolation: decoupling the foundation from the rest of the building so that the base can move in the earthquake without the rest of the building
    2. Tuned mass damper: dampens violent vibrations to keep the building stable
