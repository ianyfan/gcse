|Property|Shield|Composite|

|Location|Constructive plate boundary|Destructive plate boundary: subduction zones|
|Shape|Wide base<br>Low profiles|Steep profile<br>Some have collapsed craters called calderas|
|Eruption|Gentle & effusive|Periodically eruptive and effusive|
|Ejecta|Highly fluid basaltic, or mafic, lava with a low silica & gas content|Viscous felsic lava with a high silica & gas content<br>Ash, which can be hot and dense<br>Pyroclastic flow: a fast current of hot gas & rock<br>Volcanic bombs: large igneous rocks ejected at high speed<br>Lahars: a mixture of volcanic material and water|
|Formation|The effusive eruptions result in broad sheets of lava that steadily accumulate|When water trapped in the subducted oceanic crust is realeased into the magma, it lowers the melting point of the surrounding magma, causing it to partially melt and rise due to its lighter density<br>The magma rises through the crust, incorporating silica-rich rock, and pools in a magma chamber under or within the volcano<br>The relatively low pressure allows dissolved water & gases to escape, increasing the pressure<br>The buildup of magma & gas eventually overcomes the obstacle of the volcanic cone, causing a violent eruption|
