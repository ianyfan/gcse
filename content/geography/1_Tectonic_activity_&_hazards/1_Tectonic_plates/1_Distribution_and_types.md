1. Plate tectonics describe the large-scale movements of the Earth's lithosphere, which is broken up into several plates
2. These movements are caused by convection currents in the mantle
3. There are 7 primary plates that constitute the bulk of the continents and the Pacific Ocean: African, Antarctic, Eurasian, Indo-Australian (sometimes shown as separate Indian & Australian plates), North American, South American and Pacific
4. There are several smaller secondary plates: Arabian, Caribbean, Cocos, Indian, Juan de Fuca, Nazca, Philippine Sea and Scotia
5. The plates are about 100 km thick and consist of two types of material: continental & oceanic crust
6. Comparison:

    |:-------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------:|
    |Older: more than 1500 million years old|Younger: less than 200 million years old|
    |     Thicker: about 25-70 km thick     |      Thinner: about 7-10 km thick      |
