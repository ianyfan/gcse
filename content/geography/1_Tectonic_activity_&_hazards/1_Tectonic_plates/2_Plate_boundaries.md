1. There are 3 types of plate boundaries: destructive, constructive and conservative
2. At destructive plate boundaries, plate converge and collide: at oceanic-oceanic & oceanic-continental boundaries, the denser plate is subducted under the other and descends into the mantle; at continental-continental boundaries, continental collision occurs, whereby the plates fuse and buckle upwards
3. At constructive plate boundaries, plates move apart, causing magma to rise up from the mantle and form new crust
4. At conservative plate boundaries, plates grind each other with limited destructive or constructive activity
