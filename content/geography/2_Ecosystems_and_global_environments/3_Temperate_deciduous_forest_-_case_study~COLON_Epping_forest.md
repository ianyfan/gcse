1. ###Overview

    1. It is an ancient deciduous forest in Essex that runs north-east of London on a high gravel ridge
    2. It covers an area of about 20 km^^2^^ and is about 19 km long and 4 km wide
    3. Though 70% of Epping forest is decidous woodland, mostly beech, there are a number of other natural environments, including grasslands & marshlands
    4. It is home to a rich variety of wildlife
2. ###Uses

    1. Since Norman times, royalty have used the forest for hunting deer
    2. Locals used it for grazing animals and collecting wood for fires & buildings
    3. In 1878, the Epping Forest Act of Parliament was passed, stating that it should be kept "unenclosed and unbuild on as an open space for the recreation & enjoyment of the people", and has since been managed by the City of London Corporation
3. ###Sustainable management

    1. Over 16 km^^2^^ of forest has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a European Special Area of Conservation, which offers protection under law to its large number of ancient trees, which support a vast variety of flora & fauna
    2. For many years, the woodland was managed using pollarding, whereby trees are cut to about shoulder height, from where they then reshoot, thereby producing a supply of wood for future generations; this is above the grazing levels of the animals
    3. Management plans provide open space for the public whilst conserving the forest, including:

        1. Maintaining car parks, toilets, footpaths and refreshment facilities for reacreation
        2. Controlling recreation, such as mountain biking
        3. Preserving the herd of fallow deer
        4. Maintaining ponds to prevent them silting up
        5. Preserving ancient earthworks & buildings
