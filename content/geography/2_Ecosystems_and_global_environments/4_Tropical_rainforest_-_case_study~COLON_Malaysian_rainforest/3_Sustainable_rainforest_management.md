1. ###National Forest policy

    1. In 1977, the Malaysian government passed the National Forestry Act, paving the way for sustainable management of Malaysia's rainforests
    2. It had the following aims:

        1. Develop timber processing to increase the profitability of the exported wood and reduce demand for raw timber; the export of low-value raw logs in now banned in most of Malaysia
        2. Encourage alternative timber sources, such as rubber trees
        3. Increase public awareness of forests
        4. Increase research into forestry
        5. Involve local communities in forest projects
    3. One of the main initiatives of the act was to introduce the "Selective Management System":

        1. This was a novel approach to forest management, and is recognised as one of the most sustainable approaches to tropical forestry management in the world
        2. It establishes a 40-year-cycle for felling trees, with remedial regeneration work carried out 5-10 years after felling
        3. However, a lack of trained officials to enforce & monitor the system across the country has led to the continuation of abuses and illegal activities, and remedial measures have not always been carried out satisfactorily
2. ###Eco-tourism

    1. In recent years, Malaysia has promoted its forests as a destination for eco-tourism, which aims to introduce people to the natural world without causing any environmental damage
    2. The great benefit of eco-tourism is that it enables the undisturbed natural environment to create a source of income for local people without it being damaged or destroyed
