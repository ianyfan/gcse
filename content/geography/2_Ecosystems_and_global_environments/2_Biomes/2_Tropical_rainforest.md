1. ###Distribution

    1. They occur between the latitudes 28 degrees north & south of the equator
2. ###Climate

    1. They are characterised by high temperatures, with a mean of around 27 Â°C, and plentiful rainfall, with an annual precipitation of at least 1700 mm
3. ###Soil

    1. The soil is typically infertile since nutrients are quickly absorbed
    2. The heavy rainfall also dissolves and carries away nutrients in a process called leaching
    3. This results in an red, infertile soil called latosol, which is rich in iron and very acidic
4. ###Vegetation

    1. Tropical rainforests are the most biodiverse biomes, with over 40 thousand different species per hectare
    2. There is a clear stratification:

        1. The emergent layer has a small number of very large trees that grow above the general canopy, reaching heights of over 50 m
        2. The canopy layer, at around 40 m, contains the majority of the tallest trees: mainly tall, broad-leaved evergreen trees, as well as epiphytes
        3. The undercanopy layer, which receives only 5% of the sunlight, contains short plants with big leaves and birds, small mammals, insects and reptiles
        4. The forest floor, which receives only 2% of the sunlight, is relatively clear of sunlight, but contains decaying matter, which is relatively clear of sunlight, but contains decaying matter, which is quickly decomposed due to the hot & humid conditions
    3. Many leaves have flexible bases so that they can turn to face the sun and a drip tip to allow heavy rain to drip off the leaf
    4. Many trees have a thin, smooth bark to allow water to flow down easily
    5. Epiphytes can live on branches in the canopy for sunlight, and obtain nutrients from water & air rather than soil
    6. Buttresses have massive ridges to help support the base of tall trees and help transport water
