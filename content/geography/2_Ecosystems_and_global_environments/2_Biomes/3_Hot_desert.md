1. ###Distribution

    1. They occur in bands around 30° north & south of the equator
    2. This is where the air that rises at the equator falls, creating a persistent belt of high pressure, an anticyclone
2. ###Climate

    1. Deserts receive less than 250 mm of precipitation per year, so are very arid
    2. Temperatures can rise to 50 °C in the day and below freezing at night
3. ###Soil

    1. Desert soil is typically sandy or stony, and infertile
    2. It is dry but can soak up water rapidly after rainfall
4. ###Vegetation
    1. The vegetation is sparse and adapted to prevent water loss
