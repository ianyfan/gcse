1. ###Distribution

    1. They are found across much of Europe, eastern North America and eastern Asia
2. ###Climate

    1. Monthly mean temperature ranges between around -10 & 30 °C, with an mean temperature of around 10 °C
    2. Monthly precipitation ranges between 50 & 200 mm, with an annual precipitation of around 500 to 2000 mm
    3. Rainfall is distributed evenly throughout the year
    4. Summers are warm but not too dry; winters are cool but not too cold
3. ###Soil

    1. The soil is brown soil, since it is rich & fertile
    2. Active weathering provides plenty of nutrients, and the annual leaf fall provides organic matter to enrich the soil further
4. ###Vegetation

    1. The trees are broad-leaved, like oak, beech, birch, and ash
    2. Their broad leaves causes them to lose a lot of water via stomata, so they shed their leaves in autumn to conserve water in reduced heat & light conditions
    3. There is a wide range of habitats and a rich diversity of life, resulting in a stratification of the vegetation:
        1. A canopy of the tops of trees, mainly oak & ash
        2. A sub-canopy of smaller trees and saplings, such as hazel
        3. A herb layer of brambles, bracken, bluebells, wild garlic and ivy
        4. A ground layer close to the soil that is damp & dark so ideal for moss
    4. For much of the year, it is dark, so flowering plants, like bluebells, normally flower early in the spring before the canopy fully develops
