1. ###Overview

    1. It is one of the major hot deserts of the world, covering an area of 200 thousand km^^2^^ across north-west India and Pakistan, mostly in the Indian state of Rajasthan
    2. Summer temperatures can reach 53 Â°C in July
    3. Rainfall is low, typically between 120 & 240 mm annually
    4. There are clumps of thorn forest and other sparse vegetation
    5. The soil is generally sandy and not very fertile, as there is little organic matter to enrich them
    6. There is little surface water since the soil drains quickly
2. ###Opportunities

    1. ####Subsistence farming

        1. Most residents are involved in farming, cultivating vegetables & fruit trees and keeping a few animals in grassy areas
        2. Some crops are sold at local markets but most farming is subsistent
        3. Some people, such as the Kohlis tribe in Pakistan, are descendant of hunter-gathers and survive by hunting animals and gathering fruit & natural products, such as honey
    2. ####Irrigation and commercial farming

        1. Irrigation in parts of the desert has revolutionised farming in the area
        2. The main form of irrigation is the Indira Gandhi (Rajasthan) Canal, which was constructed in 1958 and has a total length of 650 km
        3. Two of the main areas to benefit are the cities of Jodhpur & Jaisalmar, where over 3500 km^^2^^ of land is irrigated
        4. The canal also provides drinking water to many people in the desert
        5. Commercial farming of wheat & cotton now flourishes in an area that used to be a shrub desert
    3. ####Mining and industry

        1. The desert is rich in minerals, such as gypsum, feldspar, phospherite and kaelin
        2. It also has valuable resources of stone, such as limestone & marble
        3. Local hide & wool industries form a ready market for the livestock
    4. ####Tourism

        1. In the last few years, the Thar desert has become a popular tourist destination due to its beautiful landscapes
        2. Desert safaris on camels, based in Jaisalmer, have become particularly popular with foreigners and wealthy Indians
        3. Locals benefit by working as guides or tending to camels
3. ###Sustainable management

    1. In 1977, the Desert Development Programme was started to restore the ecological balance of the region by conserving & developing land, water, livestock and human resources
    2. ####Forestry

        1. The most important tree is the <i>Prosopis cineraria</i>, since it has multiple uses and is extremely well-suited to the hostile conditions of the desert
        2. Scientists at the Central Arid Zone Research Institute have developed a hardy breed of plum tree called the Ber tree, which can survive in low rainfall and produce large profitable fruits
    3. ####Stabilising sand dunes

        1. The sand dunes are very mobile and threaten farmlands, roads and waterways
        2. Various approaches have been adopted to stabilise them, including planting blocks of trees and establishing shelter belts of trees & fences alongside roads & canals
    4. ####Thar Desert National Park

        1. This protects 3000 km^^2^^ of arid land with the endangered & rare wildlife that have adapted to the extreme conditions
