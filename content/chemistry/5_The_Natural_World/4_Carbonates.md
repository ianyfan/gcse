1. ###Thermal decomposition

    1. The carbonates of magnesium, copper, zinc, calcium and lithium thermally decompose into their respective oxide and carbon dioxide
    2. Not all Group I metal carbonates decompose at the temperatures reached by a Bunsen burner
2. ###Calcium carbonate

    1. Limestone, which contains calcium carbonate [[CaCO^3^]], is quarried and can be used as a building material, or powdered and used to control acidity in soil
    2. Calcium carbonate thermally decomposes into calcium oxide: [[CaCO^3 (s)^ → CaO^(s)^ + CO^2 (g)^]], known as quicklime which is important in the manufaction of cement, glass and extracting iron
    3. Calcium oxide reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide: [[CaO^(s)^ + H^2^O^(l)^ → Ca(OH)^2 (aq)^]], known as limewater, which can be used to test for carbon dioxide
    4. Limewater reacts with carbon dioxide to produce calcium carbonate: [[Ca(OH)^2 (aq)^ + CO^2 (g)^ → CaCO^3 (s)^ + H^2^O^(l)^]]
