1. Most methods are based on the exclusion of air & water
2. Coating the iron, in grease, oil, paint or plastic, prevents air & water from coming into contact with the iron
3. Sacrificial protection is where the iron is connected to a more reactive metal which will donate its electrons to any iron ions that form and get preferentially oxidised
