1. Rusting is the corrosion of iron
2. ###Necessary conditions

    1. Both air and water are necessary for iron to rust, which refers to the corrosion of iron
    2. Experiments can show that both are required by putting iron in four environments: oil to remove air & water, air with calcium chloride to remove water, boiled water under a layer of oil to remove air and partially submerged in water; only the partially submerged nail rusts
3. ###Prevention

    1. Most methods are based on the exclusion of air & water
    2. Coating the iron, in grease, oil, paint or plastic, prevents air & water from coming into contact with the iron
    3. Sacrificial protection the connection of iron to a more reactive metal that will donate its electrons to any iron ions that form and get preferentially oxidised
