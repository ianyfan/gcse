1. ###Air pollution

    1. Air is often polluted by carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, many of which are produced by the combustion of fuels
    2. An increase in carbon dioxide results in climate change
    3. Effects of climate change: extreme weather events, sea level rise and ocean acidification, species at increased risk of extinction, melting ice caps
    4. Sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen cause acid rain
    5. Effects of acid rain: acidic water causes damage to aquatic creatures; acidic soils can affect some plants, especially trees at high altitude; erodes building, historic monuments and statues especially those made from rocks that contain large amounts of calcium carbonate
    6. Oxides of nitrogen are toxic and can trigger some people's asthma
    7. Carbon monoxide is toxic, since red bleood cells can pick it up instead of oxygen, and is colourless and odourless
    8. Solid particles cause global dimming, and can damage lung cells and cause cancer
2. ###Metal waste

    1. Recycling metals conserves the limited reserves of ores as well as non-renewable fuel supplies
    2. It saves the energy required to extract metals, up to 95% in the case of aluminium
    3. It also reduces air pollution caused by burning fuels in the extraction process
    4. It reduces the environmental impact of mining, since open-cast mining scars the landscape, creating noise and dust and destroying wild habitats, and leaving large heaps of waste rock as well as acidifying water as rain drains through the exposed ores and slap heaps of waste
3. ###Plastic waste

    1. Many polymers are not biodegradable and take hundreds of years to break down, leading to problem with waste disposal
    2. Waste plastic becomes an eyesore and a danger to wildlife that get trapped in or eat the plastics and die
    3. Biodegradable polymers are being produced so that the plastics break down more easily, and are also being made from cornstarch to preserve supplies of crude oil
    4. However, there are problems, since this can drive up the price of corn and cause the destruction of tropical forests to create more farmland
    5. Additionally, some degradable polymers break down in light, so not do when buried in landfills
