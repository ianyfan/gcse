1. ###Composition of air

    1. Air is a mixture of gases with different boiling points
    2. It is approximately composed of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen with relatively small amounts of water vapour, carbon dioxide, neon and argon
    3. Dry air, free from carbon dioxide, can be liquefied and then fractionally distilled to obtain oxygen and nitrogen
2. ###Combustion

    1. Oxidation & reduction reactions involve the addition & removal of oxygen respectively
    2. When substances burn in air, they are reacting with the oxygen
    3. Elements can burn in air to form oxides, which can be classified as acidic, basic or amphoteric, which means they can react as an acid or a base
    4. Metal oxides are basic; non-metal oxides are acidic
