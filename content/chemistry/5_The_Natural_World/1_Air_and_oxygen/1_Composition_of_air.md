1. Air is a mixture of gases with different boiling points
2. It is approximately composed of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen with relatively small amounts of water vapour, carbon dioxide, neon and argon
3. Dry air, free from carbon dioxide, can be liquefied and then fractionally distilled to obtain oxygen and nitrogen
