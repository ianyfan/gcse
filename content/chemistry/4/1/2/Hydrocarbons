1. Hydrocarbons are molecules made up of hydrogen and carbon atoms only
2. They can be represented by their molecular or displayed form, where a line represents a covalent bond
3. They exists as different homologous series, in which they have the same general formula & structure and characteristic properties caused by their functional group
4. The suffixes used in naming depends on their functional group and the prefixes on the number of carbon atoms in the molecule, beginning: [[meth-]], [[eth-]], [[prop-]]
5. Saturated hydrocarbons contain only carbon-carbon single bonds, whereas unsaturated hydrocarbons do not
6. ###Trends

 1. Some properties of hydrocarbons depend on the size of their molecules, influencing how they are used as fuels
 2, The larger the molecule, the higher its boiling point
 3. The larger the molecule, the higher its viscosity
 4. The larger the molecule, the lower its flammability
