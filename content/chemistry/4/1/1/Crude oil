1. Crude oil is a mixture of a very large number of compounds, most of which are hydrocarbons
2. ###Fractional distillation

 1. The many hydrocarbons in crude oil can be separated into fractions
 2. This is done by evaporating the oil and feeding it into the bottom of a fractionating column
 3. As the gas rises, the temperature falls and different hydrocarbons condense off
 4. A fraction usually contains more than one type of hydrocarbon with a similar number of carbon atoms and they may require more separation
