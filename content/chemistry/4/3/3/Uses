1. Polymers have many useful applications, with new uses are being developed, such as new packaging materials, waterproof coatings for fabrics, dental polymers, wound dressing, hydrogels and smart materials (including shape memory polymers)
2. Many polymers are non-biodegradable, which can lead to problems with wast dispasal: landfill sites fill up quickly, incineration can release toxic or greenhouse gases and animals can choke on them
3. Biodegradable polymers made from cornstarch have been developed, and are being used for plastic bags
