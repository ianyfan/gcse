1. Matter can be classified in terms of three interconvertible states of matter: solid, liquid and gas[^plasma]
2. ###Properties of each state

    |State |Arrangement of molecules|Force of attraction between molecules|
    |:----:|:----------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|
    |Solid |Held in a rigid lattice |Very strong|
    |Liquid|Held together loosely, but are free to move past each other|Weaker: this allows liquids to flow|
    | Gas  |Free to move, travelling rapidly in a straight line until colliding|None: the large distances between the molecules allow the gas to change volume|
3. ###Phase transitions

    1. Melting is from solid to liquid; freezing is from liquid to solid
    2. Vaporisation is from liquid to gas; condensation is from gas to liquid
    3. Sublimation is from solid to gas; deposition is from gas to solid
4. ###Diffusion

    1. Everything is made of particles, whose existence is evident by the phenomenon of diffusion, whereby the random movement of particles of a fluid causes a net movement from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration
    2. Bromine gas is a brown gas that diffuses in air
    3. Potassium permanganate [[KMnO^4^]] is a purple crystal that diffuses in water to form a magenta-rose solution, though, being in a liquid, at a slower rate than in a gas
    4. Ammonia and hydrogen chloride are gases that diffuse in air, so when placed at either ends of a tube, travel down the tube until they meet, reacting to form a white surface of ammonium chloride: [[NH^3 (g)^ + HCl^(g)^ â†’ NH^4^Cl^(s)^]]; since hydrogen chloride molecules are heavier than ammonia ones, and speed of diffusion is inversely proportional to mass, the surface forms closer to the hydrogen chloride end



[^plasma]: There is a fourth fundamental state of matter: [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics))
