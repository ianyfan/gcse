1. ###Elements

    1. All substances are made of atoms
    2. An element is a substance that is made of only one sort of atom
    3. There are about 100 different elements[^elements]
    4. Atoms of each element are represented by a chemical symbol
2. ###The periodic table

    1. Elements are organised in the periodic table in order of atomic number
    2. Elements are represented in the periodic table as [[{{  Mass number :}{  Atomic number :}}Symbol]]
    3. The table is called the periodic table because elements with similar properties occur at regular intervals
    4. Elements in the same group have the same number of electrons in their highest energy level, which gives them similar chemical properties
    5. The metal/non-metal divide has metals on the left and non-metals on the right



[^elements]: At the time of writing, there are 118 known elements; there are 98 naturally occurring elements, of which 84 are primordial and 14 transient, and 20 synthetic elements
