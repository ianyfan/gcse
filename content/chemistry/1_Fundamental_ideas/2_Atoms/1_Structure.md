1. ###Structure

    1. Atoms have a small central nucleus of protons and neutrons, around which are electrons
    2. All atoms of a particular element have the same number of protons; atoms of different elements have different elements have different number of protons
    3. Electrons occupy particular energy levels in an atom, typically the lowest available one
    4. Every energy level has a limit to the number of electrons it can contain, starting, from the innermost shell: 2, 8, 8
3. ###Charge

    1. The relative electrical charges of protons, neutrons and electrons are:

        |Name of particle|Charge|
        |:--------------:|:----:|
        |     Proton     |  +1  |
        |    Neutron     |   0  |
        |    Electron    |  -1  |
    2. Atoms have no overall electrical charge since the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons
4. ###Mass

    1. The relative masses of protons, neutrons and electrons are:

        |Name of particle|     Relative mass     |
        |:--------------:|:---------------------:|
        |     Proton     |           1           |
        |    Neutron     |           1           |
        |    Electron    |Very small: {{1}|{1836}}|
    2. The atomic number of an atom is the number of protons in it; atoms of the same element have the same atomic number
    3. The mass number of an atom is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in it
    4. Isotopes of an element are atoms which have a different number of neutrons
    5. The relative atomic mass of an element [[A^r^]] compares the masses of atoms of the elements with the Carbon-12 isotope, and is the mean value of the mass numbers of the isotopes of the element
