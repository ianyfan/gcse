1. Limestone, which contains calcium carbonate [[CaCO<sub>3</sub>]], is quarried and can be used as a building material, or powdered and used to control acidity in soil
2. Calcium carbonate thermally decomposes into calcium oxide: [[CaCO<sub>3(s)</sub> → CaO<sub>(s)</sub> + CO<sub>2(g)</sub>]], known as quicklime which is important in the manufaction of cement, glass and extracting iron
3. Calcium oxide reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide: [[CaO<sub>(s)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> → Ca(OH)<sub>2(aq)</sub>]], known as limewater, which can be used to test for carbon dioxide
4. Limewater reacts with carbon dioxide to produce calcium carbonate: [[Ca(OH)<sub>2(aq)</sub> + CO<sub>2(g) → CaCO<sub>3(s)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>]]
