1. Limestone, which contains calcium carbonate [[CaCO!^{3}]], is quarried and can be used as a building material, or powdered and used to control acidity in soil
2. Calcium carbonate thermally decomposes into calcium oxide: [[CaCO!^{3(s)} → CaO!^{(s)} + CO!^{2(g)}]], known as quicklime which is important in the manufaction of cement, glass and extracting iron
3. Calcium oxide reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide: [[CaO!^{(s)} + H!^{2}O!^{(l)} → Ca(OH)!^{2(aq)}]], known as limewater, which can be used to test for carbon dioxide
4. Limewater reacts with carbon dioxide to produce calcium carbonate: [[Ca(OH)!^{2(aq)} + CO!^{2(g)} → CaCO!^{3(s)} + H!^{2}O!^{(l)}]]
