1. Both air and water are necessary for iron to rust, which refers to the corrosion of iron
2. Experiments can show that both are required by putting iron in four environments: oil to remove air & water, air with calcium chloride to remove water, boiled water under a layer of oil to remove air and partially submerged in water; only the partially submerged nail rusts
