1. Air is often polluted by carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, many of which are produced by the combustion of fuels
2. An increase in carbon dioxide results in climate change
3. Effects of climate change: extreme weather events, sea level rise and ocean acidification, species at increased risk of extinction, melting ice caps
4. Sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen cause acid rain
5. Effects of acid rain: acidic water causes damage to aquatic creatures; acidic soils can affect some plants, especially trees at high altitude; erodes building, historic monuments and statues especially those made from rocks that contain large amounts of calcium carbonate
6. Oxides of nitrogen are toxic and can trigger some people's asthma
7. Carbon monoxide is toxic, since red bleood cells can pick it up instead of oxygen, and is colourless and odourless
8. Solid particles cause global dimming, and can damage lung cells and cause cancer
