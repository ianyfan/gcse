1. Recycling metals conserves the limited reserves of ores as well as non-renewable fuel supplies
2. It saves the energy required to extract metals, up to 95% in the case of aluminium
3. It also reduces air pollution caused by burning fuels in the extraction process
4. It reduces the environmental impact of mining, since open-cast mining scars the landscape, creating noise and dust and destroying wild habitats, and leaving large heaps of waste rock as well as acidifying water as rain drains through the exposed ores and slap heaps of waste
