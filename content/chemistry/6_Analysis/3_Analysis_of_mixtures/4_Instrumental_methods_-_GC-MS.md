1. Instrumental methods are accurate, sensitive and rapid
2. They are particularly useful when the amount of a sample is very small
3. ###Gas chromatography

    1. Gas chromatography has the mixture vaporised and carried through a column packed with a solid by an unreactive gas called the carrier gas
    2. The stronger a substance is attracted to the solid, the slower it travels though the column, and the time it takes to travel through the column is called the retention time
    3. The retention times are recorded on a gas chromatograph and can be used to identify not only the number of substances by the number of peaks, but also the individual substances
4. ###Mass spectrometry

    1. The gas chromatography apparatus can be attached directly to a mass spectrometer to identify even small quantities of a substance very quickly and accurately
    2. The molecular mass of the substance is given by the molecular ion peak, which is the peak with the largest mass
