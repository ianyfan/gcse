1. ###Flame tests

    1. Flame tests identify metal ions based on the colour they produce in a flame
    2. This is done by using a platinum of nichrome wire that has been cleaned by dipping it in concentrated hydrochloric acid then heating it in a Bunsen burner before moistening it in the acid so that a small amount of the salt being tested can stick to it and be held at the edge of the flame
    3. Colours of typical ions:

        |Metal ions|Flame colour|
        |:--------:|:----------:|
        | Lithium  |  Crimson   |
        |  Sodium  |   Yellow   |
        |Potassium |   Lilac    |
        | Calcium  |    Red     |
        |  Barium  |   Green    |
2. ###Reaction with sodium hydroxide

    1. Some metal ions, when reacted with sodium hydroxide, produce a precipitate:

        |            Metal ion            |Precipitate colour|
        |:-------------------------------:|:----------------:|
        |Calcium<br>Magnesium<br>Aliminium|      White       |
        |           Copper (II)           |       Blue       |
        |            Iron (II)            |      Green       |
        |            Iron (III)           |      Brown       |
    2. Aluminium hydroxide dissolves in excess sodium hydroxide
3. ###Reaction with silver nitrate

    1. Halide ions, when reacted with silver nitrate solution in the presence of a catalyst of dilute nitric acid, produce a precipitate:

        | Halide |Precipitate colour|
        |:------:|:----------------:|
        |Chloride|      White       |
        |Bromide |      Cream       |
        | Iodide |      Yellow      |
4. ###Sulfate ions

    1. Sulfate ions, when reacted with barium chloride solution in the presence of a catalyst of dilute hydrochloric acid, produce a white precipitate
