1. Metals that are less reactive than carbon can be extracted from their oxides by reduction with carbon
2. For example, iron oxide is reduced in the blast furnace to extract the iron
3. The raw materials are haematite (the mineral form of iron (III) oxide with impurities), coke (carbon) and limestone (calcium carbonate) from the top, and hot air from the bottom
4. The oxygen reacts with the carbon to form carbon dioxide: [[C<sub>(s)</sub> + O<sub>2(g)</sub> → CO<sub>2(g)</sub>]]
5. The carbon dioxide reacts with more carbon to form carbon monoxide: [[CO<sub>2(g)</sub> + C<sub>(s)</sub> → 2CO<sub>(g)</sub>]]
6. Carbon monoxide is the reducing agent for haematite: [[Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3(s)</sub> + 3CO<sub>(g)</sub> → 2Fe<sub>(l)</sub> + 3CO<sub>2(g)</sub>]]
7. A notable impurity in haematite is silica, which is removed using limestone: first, the limestone thermally decomposes to produce calcium oxide, which reacts with the silicon dioxide to form calcium silicate: [[CaO<sub>(s)</sub> + SiO<sub>2(s)</sub> → CaSiO<sub>3(l)</sub>]]
8. The calcium silicate, and other by-products, form slag, which sinks to the bottom of the blast furnace and is removed, to be used in cement
9. The iron floats on top of the slag and is removed (see 3.1)
