1. Displacement reactions involving metals and their compounds in aqueous solutions establish positions in the reactivity series, wherein metals displace les reactive metals
2. Displacement reactions can be described in terms of oxidation & reduction: the displacing metal is oxidised and the displaced metal is reduced; since both occur, these reactions are called redox reactions
