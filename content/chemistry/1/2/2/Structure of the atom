1. ###Structure

 1. Atoms have a small central nucleus of protons and neutrons, around which are electrons
 2. Electrons occupy particular energy levels in an atom, generally the lowest available one
 3. All atoms of a particular element have the same number of protons; atoms of different elements have different elements have different number of protons
2. ###Charge

 1. The relative electrical charges of protons, neutrons and electrons are:

        |Name of particle|Charge|
        |:--------------:|:----:|
        |     Proton     |  +1  |
        |    Neutron     |   0  |
        |    Electron    |  -1  |
 2. Atoms have no overall electrical charge since the number of electrons is equal to the nember of protons
3. ###Mass

 1. The relative masses of protons, neutrons and electrons are:

        |Name of particle|     Relative mass     |
        |:--------------:|:---------------------:|
        |     Proton     |           1           |
        |    Neutron     |           1           |
        |    Electron    |Very small:{{1}/{1836}}|
 2. The number of protons in an atoms of an element is its atomic number and the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in an atom is its mass number
 3. Elements are represented in the periodic table as <i class="equation">{{Mass number}:|{Atomic number}:}Symbol</i>
 4. Isotopes of an element are atoms which have a different number of neutrons
 5. The relative atomic mass of an element [[A!^{r}]] compares the masses of atoms of the elements with the Carbon-12 isotope, and is the mean value for the mass number of the isotopes of the element
