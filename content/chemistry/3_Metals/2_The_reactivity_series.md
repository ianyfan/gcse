1. ###Reaction with water and dilute acids

    1. Metals can be arranged in an order of their reactivity from how vigorous their reactivity from how vigorous their reactions are with water and dilute acids

        |                                Order of reactivity                                 |                              Reaction with water                              |           Reaction with dilute acid          |
        |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
        |                 Potassium [[K]]<br>Sodium [[Na]]<br>Lithium [[Li]]                 |{rowspan=2}Effervesce hydrogen, leaving an alkaline solution of metal hydroxide|                   Explode                    |
        |                                   Calcium [[Ca]]                                   |{merged}                                                                       |{rowspan=2}Effervesce hydrogen, forming a salt|
        |Magnesium [[Mg]]<br>Aluminium [[Al]]<br>(Carbon [[C]])<br>Zinc [[Zn]]<br>Iron [[Fe]]|       React with steam, effervescing hydrogen, forming the metal oxide        |{merged}                                      |
        |                             Tin [[Sn]]<br>Lead [[Pb]]                              |                          Slight reaction with steam                           |         React slowly with warm acid          |
        |         (Hydrogen [[H]])<br>Copper [[Cu]]<br>Silver [[Ag]]<br>Gold [[Au]]          |                         No reaction, even with steam                          |                 No reaction                  |
    2. The non-metals hydrogen & carbon are often included in the reactivity series based on the reactions of metals with dilute acid and metal oxides with carbon
2. ###Single displacement reactions

    1. Displacement reactions involving metals and their compounds in aqueous solutions establish positions in the reactivity series, wherein metals displace less reactive metals
    2. Displacement reactions can be described in terms of oxidation & reduction: the displacing metal is oxidised and the displaced metal is reduced; since both occur, these reactions are called redox reactions
