1. Metals can be arranged in an order of their reactivity from how vigorous their reactivity from how vigorous their reactions are with water and dilute acids

    |                                Order of reactivity                                 |                              Reaction with water                              |           Reaction with dilute acid          |
    |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
    |                 Potassium [[K]]<br>Sodium [[Na]]<br>Lithium [[Li]]                 |{rowspan=2}Effervesce hydrogen, leaving an alkaline solution of metal hydroxide|                   Explode                    |
    |                                   Calcium [[Ca]]                                   |{merged}                                                                       |{rowspan=2}Effervesce hydrogen, forming a salt|
    |Magnesium [[Mg]]<br>Aluminium [[Al]]<br>(Carbon [[C]])<br>Zinc [[Zn]]<br>Iron [[Fe]]|       React with steam, effervescing hydrogen, forming the metal oxide        |{merged}                                      |
    |                             Tin [[Sn]]<br>Lead [[Pb]]                              |                          Slight reaction with steam                           |         React slowly with warm acid          |
    |         (Hydrogen [[H]])<br>Copper [[Cu]]<br>Silver [[Ag]]<br>Gold [[Au]]          |                         No reaction, even with steam                          |                 No reaction                  |
2. The non-metals hydrogen & carbon are often included in the reactivity series based on the reactions of metals with dilute acid and metal oxides with carbon
