|      Metal      |Properties|Uses|
|:---------------:|:---------|:---|
|Transition metals|    Appear in the central block of the periodic table<br>Good conductors of heat and electricity<br>Can be bent or hammered into shape    |    Structural materials<br>Things that must allow heat or electricity to pass through them easily    |
|       Iron      |    Iron from the blast furnace contains about 96% iron<br>The impurities make it brittle and so it has limited uses<br>Made into cast iron, which is hard and not easily compressed    |    Cast iron: wood-burning stoves, man-hole covers and engines    |
|      Steel      |    Most iron is converted into steel, which are alloys of iron & carbon, sometimes with other metals too<br>Steels can be designed to have properties for specific uses: low-carbon steels are easily shaped, high-carbon steels are hard and stainless steels are resistant to corrosion    |    Low-carbon: car bodies<br>Stainless: cooking utensils and cutlery    |
|      Copper     |    Good conductor of heat and electricity<br>Can be bent but is hard enough to make pipes or tanks<br>Does not react with water    |    Electrical wiring<br>Plumbing    |
