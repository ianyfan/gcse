|       Iron      |Pig iron from the blast furnace contains about 96% iron<br>The impurities make it brittle so it has limited uses<br>Pig iron is made into cast iron is hard and not easily compressed                          |Cast iron: wood-burning stoves, man-hole covers and engines<br>Most iron is converted into steels, alloys of iron & carbon, sometimes with other metals|
|      Steel      |Steels can be designed to have properties for specific uses: low-carbon steels are easily shaped, high-carbon steels are hard and stainless steels, which contain chromium & nickel, are resistant to corrosion|Low-carbon steel: car bodies<br>Stainless steel: cooking utensils and cutlery                                                                          |
