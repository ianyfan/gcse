1. Metals that are more reactive than carbon, such as aluminium, are extracted by electrolysis of molten compounds
2. The use of large amounts of energy makes this process expensive
3. ###Process

    1. When an ionic substance, called the electrolyte, is melted or dissolved in water, the ions are free to move about within the liquid or solution, and passing an electric current though it separates them into their elements
    2. Cations are attracted to the negatively-charged electrode, called the cathode, and anions are attracted to the positively-charged electrode, called the anode
    3. Oxidation and reduction can be defined as the loss and gain of electrons respectively
    4. At the cathode, cations are reduced, and at the anode, anions are oxidised
    5. Reactions at electrodes can be represented by half equations, which show the change in oxidation state of a substance
    6. ####Preferential deionisation

        1. When a mixture of ions gather at an electrode, there is a hierarchy as to which ions are deionised
        2. At the cathode, less reactive elements are preferentially deionised
        3. At the anode, more concentrated ions are preferentially deionised: halides then hydroxide [[OH^^-^^]] then anything else
4. ###Extraction of aluminium

    1. Aluminium is extracted by the electrolysis of a molten mixture of aluminium oxide and cryolite, which is used to reduce the melting point
    2. The aluminium oxide breaks down into its ions: [[Al^2^O^3 (l)^ → 2Al{{3+}{(l)}} + 3O{{2-}{(l)}}]]
    3. At the cathode, aluminium ions are oxidised: [[Al{{3+}{(l)}} + 3e^^-^^ → Al^(l)^]]
    4. At the anode, oxygen ions are reduced: [[O{{2-}{(l)}} → O^(l)^ + 2e^^-^^]]
    5. The overall reaction is [[2Al^2^O^3 (l)^ → 4Al^(l)^ + 3O^2 (l)^]]
    6. The anode is made of carbon, which reacts with the oxygen to produce carbon dioxide
    7. Large amounts of energy are required for this process
5. ###Other uses of electrolysis: sodium chloride (brine)

    1. The electrolysis of sodium chloride solution produces hydrogen and chlorine, as well as sodium hydroxide solution, which are all very important in the chemical industry
    2. The ions present in the sodium chloride solution are: [[Na{{+}{(aq)}},]] [[Cl{{-}{(aq)}},]] [[H{{+}{(aq)}}]] and [[OH{{-}{(aq)}}]]
    3. The sodium & hydrogen ions are attracted to the cation where the hydrogen is preferentially reduced: [[2H{{+}{(aq)}} + 2e^^-^^ → H^2 (g)^]]
    4. The chloride & hydroxide ions are attracted to the anion where the chloride ions are preferentially oxidised: [[2Cl{{-}{(aq)}} → Cl^2 (g)^ + 2e^^-^^]]
    5. The remaining sodium & hydroxide ions react to form sodium hydroxide solution: [[Na{{+}{(aq)}} + OH{{-}{(aq)}} → NaOH^(aq)^]]
    6. Sodium hydroxide is used in the production of soap and paper
    7. Chlorine reacts with sodium hydroxide to form a solution of bleach and is also important in making many other disinfectants, as well as plastics, such as PVC
    8. The hydrogen produced is particularly pure, making it useful in the food industry: margarine is made by reacting hydrogen with vegetable oils
4. ###Other uses of electrolysis: Electroplating

    1. Electrolysis is used to electroplate objects for reasons such as appearance, durability, the prevention of corrosion and cost reduction
    2. Electroplating has the plating metal as the anode and the plated metal at the cathode in a salt solution that has either the plating metal or a metal that is more reactive than the plating metal
    3. As well as the conventional electrolysis process, the plating metal is oxidised and gets released from the anode, getting attracted to the cathode where it is preferentially reduced over the metal in the salt
    4. This forms a layer of plating metal over the plated metal
