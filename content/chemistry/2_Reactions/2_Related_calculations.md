1. Relative formula mass

    1. The relative formula mass *M^r^* of a compound is the sum of the relative atomic masses of the atoms in the number shown in the formula
    2. The relative formula mass of a substance, in grams, is known as one mole of that substance
    3. The percentage, by mass, of an element in a compound is equal to the relative atomic mass of the element, multiplied by the number of atoms of the element in the compound, divided by the relative formula mass of the compound
    4. The empirical formula of a compound can be determined from the masses or percentage masses of the elements in the compound by calculating the simplest integer ratio of the moles of the elements
    5. The molecular formula of a compound can be determined from the empirical formula and the relative formula mass of the compound by taking the multiple of the number of atoms that makes the mass equal to the relative formula mass
    6. The molar concentration of a solution is the number of moles of solute dissolved per cubic decimetre of solvent
2. ###Yield

    1. The amount of a product obtained is known as the yield
    2. The percentage yield is equal to the yield divided by the theoretical maximum amount
