1. Bases are metal oxides & hydroxides
2. Alkalis are soluble bases
3. Ammonia dissolves in water to form an alkaline solution, and produces ammonium salts that are important as fertilisers
4. ###pH

    1. The pH scale is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution
    2. It is a logarithmic scale with pH 7 denoting a neutral solution and with most solutions having a pH between 0 & 14
    3. The Arrhenius theory states that acids dissociate when dissolved in water and increase the concentration of Hydrogen ions, [[H{{+}{(aq)}}]], in solution, whilst alkalis increase the concentration of Hydroxide ions, [[OH{{-}{(aq)}}]][^BL]
    4. Universal indicator is a solution of several compounds that exhibits several smooth colour changes over the pH scale that correlates with the visible spectrum, with green denoting pH 7



[^BL]: The more accepted Br√∏nsted-Lowry theory states that in an acid-base equation, the acid donate a Hydrogen ion to form its conjugate base, whilst the base accepts a Hydrogen ion to form its conjugate acid
