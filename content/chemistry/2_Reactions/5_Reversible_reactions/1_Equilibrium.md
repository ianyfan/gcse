1. For reversible reaction in a closed system, equilibrium is reached when the reactions occur at exactly the same rate in both directions
2. The relative amounts of the substances in the reaction at equilibrium depends on the conditions of the reaction
3. An increase in temperature favours the endothermic reaction and a decrease in temperature favours the exothermic reaction
4. In gaseous reactions, an increase in temperature favours the reaction that produces the least number of molecules, and a decrease in temperature favours the reaction that produces the greatest number of molecules
5. These factors, along with reaction rates, are important when determining the optimum conditions in industrial processes such as the Haber process
