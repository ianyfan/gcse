1. ###Raw materials

    1. The raw materials for the Haber process are nitrogen and hydrogen
    2. Nitrogen in obtained from the air
    3. Hydrogen may be obtained from natural gas or other sources
2. ###Process

    1. The purified gases are passed over a catalyst of iron at a high temperature (about 450 Â°C) and high pressure (about 200 atmospheres)
    2. Some of the hydrogen and nitrogen react to form ammonia
    3. The reaction is reversible so some ammonia breaks down again into nitrogen and hydrogen
    4. The produced ammonia is cooled so it liquifies, and is removed
    5. The remaining nitrogen and hydrogen is recycled
