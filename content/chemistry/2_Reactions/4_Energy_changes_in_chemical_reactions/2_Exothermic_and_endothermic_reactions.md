1. ###Exothermic

 1. An exothermic reaction transfers energy to the surroundings and therefore has a negative energy change
 2. In an exothermic reaction, the energy released from forming new bonds is greater than the energy required to break existing bonds
 3. Examples of exothermic reactions include combustion, many oxidation reactions and neutralisation
 4. Applications of exothermic reactions include self-heating cans and hand warmers
2. ###Endothermic

 1. An endothermic reaction takes in energy from the surroundings and therefore has a positive energy change
 2. In an endothermic reaction, the energy released from forming new bonds is lower than the energy required to break existing bonds
 3. Examples of endothermic reactions include thermal decomposition
 4. Applications of endothermic reactions include some sports injury packs
3. ###Reversible

 1. If a reversible reaction is exothermic in one direction, it is endothermic in the opposite direction, with the same amount of energy being transferred in each case
