1. Increasing the temperature increases the speed of the reacting particles so they collide more frequently & energetically
2. Increasing the pressure of gaseous reactants increases the frequency of collisions
3. Increasing the concentration of aqueous reactants increases the frequency of collisions
4. Increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the frequency of collisions
5. Catalysts increase the rate of reaction without being expended; different reactions require different catalysts
6. Catalysts are important in reducing the cost of industrial processes
