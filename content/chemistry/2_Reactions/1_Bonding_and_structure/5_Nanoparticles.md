1. Nanoparticles are structures that are 1-100 nm in size with a few hundred atoms
2. They show properties different from those for the same substance in bulk
3. They have a high surface area to volume ratio
4. This may lead to the development of new computers, catalysts, coatings, highly selective sensors, stronger & lighter construction materials and cosmetics such as suntan creams & deodorants
