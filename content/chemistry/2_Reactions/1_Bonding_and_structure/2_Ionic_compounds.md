1. ###Bonding

 1. When atoms transfer electrons, they form ions
 2. Ions have the electron arrangement of a noble gas, which is denoted using square brackets with the charge superscripted
 3. Atoms that lose electrons become positively-charged ions called cations
 4. Atoms that gain electrons become negatively-charged ions called anions
 5. The charge on simple ions can be calculated from their group number, wherein cations have a charge equal to their group number and anions have a charge equal to their group number minus 8
 6. Compounds formed from metals and non-metals consist of ions where the metal is the cation and the non-metal is the anion
2. ###Structure

 1. An ionic compound is a giant structure of ions
 2. They are held together by strong electrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely-charged ions acting in all directions in the lattice
 3. The structure of sodium of sodium chloride is a cubic lattice of ions where adjacent ions are different
3. ###Properties
 
 1. They have high melting & boiling points since large amounts of energy are required to overcome the many strong electrostatic forces
 2. When melted or dissolved in water, they conduct electricity because the ions dissociate so are free to move and carry the current
