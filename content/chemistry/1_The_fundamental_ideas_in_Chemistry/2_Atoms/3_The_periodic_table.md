1. Elements are organised in the periodic table in order of atomic number
2. The table is called the periodic table because elements with similar properties occur at regular intervals
3. Elements in the same group have the same number of electrons in their highest energy level and this gives them similar chemical properties
4. The metal/non-metal divide has metals on the left and non-metals on the right
