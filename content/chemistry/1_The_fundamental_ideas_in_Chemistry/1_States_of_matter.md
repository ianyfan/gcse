1. Matter can be classified in terms of three interconvertible states of matter: solid, liquid and gas
2. ###Phase transitions

    1. Melting is from solid to liquid; freezing is from liquid to solid
    2. Vaporisation is from liquid to gas; condensation is from gas to liquid
    3. Sublimation is from solid to gas; deposition is from gas to solid
3. Evidence for the existence of particles can be obtained from simple experiments, such as the diffusion of bromine in air, ammonia in hydrochloric acid and potassium manganate in water
