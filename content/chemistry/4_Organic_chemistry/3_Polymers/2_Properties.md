1. The properties of polymers depend on what they are made from and conditions they are made under: low-density (LD) and high-density (HD) poly(ethene) are produced using different catalysts and reaction conditions
2. LD poly(ethene), under very high pressures and a trace of oxygen, forms randomly branched chains that cannot pack closely together, hence its lower density
3. HD poly(ethene), using a catalyst at 50 Â°C and a slightly raised pressure, forms straighter chains which can pack more closely, hence its higher density; it has a higher softening temperature and is stronger than LD poly(ethene)
4. ###Thermosoftening and thermosetting

 1. Thermosoftening polymers consist of individual, tangled polymer chains
 2. Thermosetting polymers consist of polymer chains with cross-links between them
 3. Thermosoftening polymers have very weak bonds between the chains that are easily broken when heated, making the polymer become soft; the cross-links in thermosetting polymers are strong covalent bonds that make the polymer rigid and heat-resistant
