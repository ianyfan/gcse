1. ###Polymerisation

    1. Alkenes can be used to make polymers such as poly(ethene) and poly(propene)
    2. In polymerisation reactions, many small molecules, called monomers, join together to form very large molecules called polymers
    3. Individual carbon-carbon double bonds are broken and replaced with single bonds
2. ###Properties

    1. The properties of polymers depend on what they are made from and conditions they are made under: low-density (LD) and high-density (HD) poly(ethene) are produced using different catalysts and reaction conditions
    2. LD poly(ethene), under very high pressures and a trace of oxygen, forms randomly branched chains that cannot pack closely together, hence its lower density
    3. HD poly(ethene), using a catalyst at 50 Â°C and a slightly raised pressure, forms straighter chains which can pack more closely, hence its higher density; it has a higher softening temperature and is stronger than LD poly(ethene)
    4. ####Thermosoftening and thermosetting

        1. Thermosoftening polymers consist of individual, tangled polymer chains
        2. Thermosetting polymers consist of polymer chains with cross-links between them
        3. Thermosoftening polymers have very weak bonds between the chains that are easily broken when heated, making the polymer become soft; the cross-links in thermosetting polymers are strong covalent bonds that make the polymer rigid and heat-resistant
3. ###Uses

    1. Polymers have many useful applications, with new uses are being developed, such as new packaging materials, waterproof coatings for fabrics, dental polymers, wound dressing, hydrogels and smart materials (including shape memory polymers)
    2. Many polymers are non-biodegradable, which can lead to problems with wast disposal: landfill sites fill up quickly, incineration can release toxic or greenhouse gases and animals can choke on them
    3. Biodegradable polymers made from cornstarch have been developed, and are being used for plastic bags
