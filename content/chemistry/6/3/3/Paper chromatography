1. Paper chromatography can be used to analyse the substances in a solution, such as food colouring and inks or dyes
2. It involves a piece of paper, called the stationary phase, with one end placed in a solvent, called the mobile phase
3. A base line on the stationary phase is determined and a spot of solution is placed on it
4. The mobile phase is absorbed by the stationary phase and begins travelling up it, creating a line called the solvent front
5. As the solvent front travels past the base line, substances in the solution dissolve in the mobile phase and begin moving with the solvent front
6. At particular distances, different substances, andt finally the mobile phase, stop moving
7. The distance travelled by a substance is divided by the distance travelled by the solvent front to determint the retention factor [[R<sub>f</sub>]] of the substance in the solvent and can be cross-referenced to an index of known retention factors in that solvent at that temperature to determine the substance
8. The higher the retention factor, the more soluble the substance is in the solvent
