1. Comparators have a greater sensitivity than transistor switches
2. The output is low if the non-inverting input is lower than the inverting output and high if the non-inverting input is higher than the inverting input
3. Comparators can be used with input sensors so that when the input voltage rises above a certain threshold, the comparator outputs a signal to the rest of the circuit
3. Comparators are unable to drive a very high current so a transistor is often used as a transducer driver
