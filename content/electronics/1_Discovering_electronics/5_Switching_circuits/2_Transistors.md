1. ###NPN transistor

    1. Circuit diagram: ![NPN transistor symbol](/gcse/img/electronics/npntransistor.png)
    2. Leads: corresponding to the diagram with the flat side pointing to the right
    3. A small base current be used to control a much larger load current
    4. The transistor is off if [[V^IN^ < 0.7 V]] and on if [[V^IN^ Â‰ 0.7 V]]
2. ###N channel MOSFET

    1. Circuit diagram: ![MOSFET symbol](/gcse/img/electronics/mosfet.png)
    2. Leads: corresponding to the diagram with the flat side pointing to the right
    3. MOSFET stands for Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor
    4. A MOSFET is on at any non-zero voltage and draws very little current, so is ideal for driving heavy loads from the output of a logic system, since they cannot drive high currents
