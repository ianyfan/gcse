1. ###Principle

    1. Diodes only conduct when forward biased
    2. A diodes can be used to allow a current in one direction and prevent current in the opposite direction in parts of a circuit
    3. The forward volt drop across a forward biased silicon diode is about 0.7 V
2. ###Uses

    1. A diode is used to protect transistors and comparators for circuits that drive motors and solenoids
