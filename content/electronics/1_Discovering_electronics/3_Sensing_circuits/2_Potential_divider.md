1. A potential divider circuit is used to produce an output voltage that is a fraction of the input voltage: ![potential divider circuit diagram](/gcse/img/electronics/potentialdivider.png)
2. The potential divider rule states: [[V^out^ = {{: R^2^ :}|{: R^1^ + R^2^ :}}â‹…V^in^]]
3. Fixed resistors can be used in a potential divider to produce an output voltage that is a known fraction of the input voltage
4. A variable resistor can be used in a potential divider to produce an output voltage that is controlled by changing the resistance in the variable resister
5. A potentiometer a three-terminal resistor with a sliding contact that forms an adjustable potential divider
