1. ###Changing resistance

    1. Resistance can be increased by connecting resistors in series: [[R = R^1^ + R^2^]]
    2. Resistance can be decreased by connecting resistors in parallel: [[{{1}/{R}} = {{: 1 :}|{: R^1^ :}} + {{: 1 :}|{: R^2^ :}}]]
2. ###Types

    1. A light-dependent resistor (LDR) is a resistor whose resistance decreases in a non-linear fashion as light intensity increases
    2. A "negative temperature coefficient" thermistor is a resistor whose resistance decreases in a non-linear fashion as temperature increases
3. ###Practice

    1. The resistance of a resistor is denoted by bands of colour on them
    2. The first bands of colour represent a value that is multiplied by 10 to the power of the penultimate band to calculate the total resistance
    3. The final band represents the resistor's tolerance
    4. Colour code:

        |Colour|Value|
        |:----:|:---:|
        |Black |  0  |
        |Brown |  1  |
        | Red  |  2  |
        |Orange|  3  |
        |Yellow|  4  |
        |Green |  5  |
        | Blue |  6  |
        |Violet|  7  |
        | Grey |  8  |
        |White |  9  |
        |Silver|±10% |
        | Gold | ±5% |
    5. The E24 series is a logarithmic scale of 24 resistance values to 2 significant figures with a 5% tolerance, from which resistors should be chosen from
    6. In practice, when a resistance is needed, the least resistant resistor with a resistance higher than the required resistance is used to limit the current
