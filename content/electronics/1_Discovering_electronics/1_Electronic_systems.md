1. A system can be defined as something that responds in a predictable way when it receives input signals
2. Electronic systems can be divided up into three sections: input sensing, signal processing and output devices
3. The subsystems in an electronic system can be represented as individual blocks in a block diagram, with arrows showing the path of signal
