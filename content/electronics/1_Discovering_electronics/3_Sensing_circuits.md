1. ###Resistors

    1. ####Changing resistance

        1. Resistance can be increased by connecting resistors in series: [[R = R^1^ + R^2^]]
        2. Resistance can be decreased by connecting resistors in parallel: [[{{: 1 :}|{: R :}} = {{: 1 :}|{: R^1^ :}} + {{: 1 :}|{: R^2^ :}}]]
    2. ####Types

        1. A light-dependent resistor (LDR) is a resistor whose resistance decreases in a non-linear fashion as light intensity increases
        2. A "negative temperature coefficient" thermistor is a resistor whose resistance decreases in a non-linear fashion as temperature increases
    3. ####Practice

        1. The resistance of a resistor is denoted by bands of colour on them
        2. The first bands of colour represent a value that is multiplied by 10 to the power of the penultimate band to calculate the total resistance
        3. The final band represents the resistor's tolerance
        4. Colour code:

            |Colour|Value|
            |:----:|:---:|
            |Black |  0  |
            |Brown |  1  |
            | Red  |  2  |
            |Orange|  3  |
            |Yellow|  4  |
            |Green |  5  |
            | Blue |  6  |
            |Violet|  7  |
            | Grey |  8  |
            |White |  9  |
            |Silver|±10% |
            | Gold | ±5% |
        5. The E24 series is a logarithmic scale of 24 resistance values to 2 significant figures with a 5% tolerance, from which resistors should be chosen from
        6. In practice, when a resistance is needed, the least resistant resistor with a resistance higher than the required resistance is used to limit the current
2. ###Potential divider

    1. A potential divider circuit is used to produce an output voltage that is a fraction of the input voltage: ![potential divider circuit diagram](/gcse/img/electronics/potentialdivider.png)
    2. The potential divider rule states: [[V^out^ = {{: R^2^ :}|{: R^1^ + R^2^ :}}⋅V^in^]]
    3. Fixed resistors can be used in a potential divider to produce an output voltage that is a known fraction of the input voltage
    4. A variable resistor can be used in a potential divider to produce an output voltage that is controlled by changing the resistance in the variable resister
    5. A potentiometer a three-terminal resistor with a sliding contact that forms an adjustable potential divider
3. ###Switches

    | Type |Function|
    |:----:|:------:|
    | Push |It causes a temporary change in state whilst physically actuated|
    |Toggle|It is manually actuated by a mechanical lever, handle or rocking mechanism|
    | Reed |It is a pair of contacts on ferrous metal reeds that is actuated in magnetic field|
    |Micro |It is actuated at very high speed by very little physical force but separating the contacts requires significant force in the opposite direction|
    | Tilt |It is actuated using a small amount of liquid mercury, or ball bearings, which falls onto the contacts under gravity when the switch is tilted to an appropriate angle|
    |Rotary|It is operated by rotation and is often used when more than two positions are needed|
