1. Standard component symbols: ![Table of component symbols](/gcse/img/electronics/symbols.png)
2. ###Current

    1. Current is the flow of charge and is preserved in a circuit
    2. The current at a junction rule states that any junction in a circuit, the sum of the currents flowing into it is equal to the sum of the currents flowing out of it
3. ###Voltage

    1. Voltage is the electric potential energy per unit charge between two points, and is used up in a circuit
    2. The voltage at a point is indicated by calculating the potential difference relative to a 0 V reference using the voltage drops of the components in the circuit
    3. Analogue signals continuously vary and digital signals are two-state
4. ###Resistance

    1. Resistance is the opposition to current flow and is measured in ohms [[Ω]]
    2. The potential difference between two points is equal to the product of the current & resistance: [[V = IR]]
5. ###Power

    1. Power is dissipated when current flows through resistance and is measured in Watts [[W]]
    2. The power is equal to the product of the voltage & current: [[P = VI]]
