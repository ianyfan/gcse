1. ###Output devices

    | Device | Function |
    |:------:|:--------:|
    | Buzzer |Produces sound|
    |  Lamp  |Produces light<br>Most are filament lamps that burn out after around 1000 hours of continuous use|
    |Light-emitting diode (LED)|Produces light more efficiently than a lamp, so does not get so hot, in a larger variety of colours, and lasts longer, around 100,000 hours of continuous use|
    | Motors |Produces movement|
    |Solenoid|Produces a magnetic field|
2. ###Current-limiting resistor 

    1. If a component drops (virtually) no resistance, if no other components are wired in series, a very high current, effectively infinite, flows through the component, breaking it, so a resistor must be wired in series in order to limit the current
    2. For example: an LED drops 2 V and the standard maximum current used to drive it is 350 mA
    3. The current-limiting resistor has a resistance calculated using Ohm's law: [[{{: e.m.f. - 2 V :}|{: 350 mA :}}]]
