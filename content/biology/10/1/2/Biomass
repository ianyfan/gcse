1. The mass of living material at each stage in a food chain is less than it was at the previous stage
2. This is because some materials & energy are always lost in the organisms' waste materials
3. Also, respiration supplies all the energy needed for living processes and much of this energy is eventually transferred to the surroundings
4. The biomass as each stage can be drawn to scale and shown as a pyramid of biomass
