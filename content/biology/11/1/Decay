1. Living organisms remove materials from the environment for growth and other processes, and these materials are returned to the environment either in waste materials or when living things die & decay
2. Materials decay because they are digested by microorganisms, which are more active and digest materials faster in warm, moist, aerobic conditions
3. The decay process releases substances that plants need to grow
4. In a stable community, the processes that remove materials are balanced by processes that return materials, and so the materials are part of a constant cycle
