1. Carbon dioxide is removed from the environment by green plants and algae during photosynthesis
2. The carbon from the carbon dioxide is used to make carbohydrates, fats and proteins, which make up the body of plants & algae
3. When green plants and algae respire, some of this carbon becomes carbon dioxide and is released into the atmosphere
4. When green plants and algae are eaten by animals and these animals are eaten by other animals, some of the carbon becomes part of the fats & proteins that make up their bodies
5. When animals respire, some of this carbon becomes carbon dioxide and is released into the atmosphere
