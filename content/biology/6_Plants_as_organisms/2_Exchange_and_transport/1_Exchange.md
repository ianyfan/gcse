1. ###Gas exchange
 1. Plants have stomata on the epidermis of leaves to obtain carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and remove oxygen produced in photosynthesis
 2. Leaves have a large surface area due to its flattened shape and internal air spaces
 3. The size of stomata is controlled by guard cells that surround them

2. ###Water exchange
 1. Most of the water and mineral ions are absorbed by roots
 2. The surface area of roots is increased by root hair cells
 3. Plants mainly lose water vapour from leaves, especially through stomata
 4. Evaporation is more rapid in hot, dry and windy conditions
 5. If plants lose water faster than it is replaced, stomata con close to prevent wilting
