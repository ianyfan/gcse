1. Flowering plants have separate transport systems
2. Xylem tissue transports water & mineral ions from the roots to the stems & leaves
3. The movement of water from the roots through the xylem and out of the leaves is known as the transpiration stream
4. Phloem tissue transports dissolved sugars from the leaves to the rest of the plant, including the growing regions and the storage organs, in a process called translocation
