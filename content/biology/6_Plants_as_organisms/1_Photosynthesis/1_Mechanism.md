1. During photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll, which is found in chloroplasts in some plant cells and in algae
2. This energy is used to convert carbon dioxide, from the air, and water, from the soil, into glucose
3. Oxygen is released as a by-product
4. Photosynthesis is summarised by the equation: [[6CO^2(g)^ + 6H^2^O^(l)^ â†’ C^6^H^12^O^6(aq)^ + 6O^2(g)^]]
