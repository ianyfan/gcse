1. ###Mechanism

    1. During photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll, which is found in chloroplasts in some plant cells and in algae
    2. This energy is used to convert carbon dioxide, from the air, and water, from the soil, into glucose
    3. Oxygen is released as a by-product
    4. Photosynthesis is summarised by the equation: [[6CO^2 (g)^ + 6H^2^O^(l)^ â†’ C^6^H^12^O^6 (aq)^ + 6O^2 (g)^]]
2. ###Rate

    1. ####Limiting factors

        1. Low temperature, since enzymes do not work optimally
        2. Shortage of carbon dioxide
        3. Shortage of light
        4. Lack of chlorophyll
    2. In a greenhouse: temperature, carbon dioxide concentration and light intensity are enhanced to ensure optimum photosynthesising conditions
3. ###Uses of glucose

    1. Respiration
    2. Converted into insoluble starch for storage
    3. To produce fat or oil for storage
    4. To produce cellulose, which strengthens the cell wall
    5. To produce proteins
4. ###Protein production

    1. To produce proteins, plants also use nitrate ions from the soil
    2. Carnivorous plants, such as the Venus Fly Trap, are adapted to live in nutrient-poor soil as they obtain most of their nutrients from the animals they catch, such as insects
