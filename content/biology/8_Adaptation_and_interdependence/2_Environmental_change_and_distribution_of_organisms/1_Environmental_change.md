1. Changes in the environment affect the distribution of living organisms
2. ###Environmental factors

    1. Change in numbers or types of competitor
    2. Temperature
    3. Amount of light
    4. Availability of nutrients
    5. Availability of water
    6. Availability of oxygen & carbon dioxide
    7. Availability of nesting sites, shelter and appropriate habitats
