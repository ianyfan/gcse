1. Humans reduce the amount of land available for other animals and plants by building, quarrying, farming and dumping waste
2. Large-scale deforestation in tropical areas occurs so that there can be increases in cattle and rice fields to provide more food and so crops can be grown to produce ethanol-based biofuels

3. ###Effects
 1. An increase in the release of methane in the atmosphere due to cattle
 2. An increase of the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere due to burning and the activities of microorganisms
 3. A decrease in the rate at which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and "locked up" for hundreds of years as wood
 4. A decrease in biodiversity
