1. Levels of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere are increasing and contribute to "global warning"
2. Carbon dioxide may be sequestered in oceans, lakes and ponds, and this is an important factor in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
3. ###Peat

    1. The destruction of peat bogs, and other areas of peat, releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere since the peat is used in compost and decayed by microorganisms that release carbon dioxide during respiration
    2. Using peat-free composts means that peat bogs will not be destroyed
4. ###Effects of an increase in Earth's temperature

    1. Big changes in Earth's climate
    2. Rising sea levels
    3. Changes in migration patterns, such birds'
    4. Changes in the distribution of species
    5. Reducing biodiversity
