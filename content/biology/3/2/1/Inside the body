1. Enzymes are biological catalysts, which increase the rate of chemical reactions
2. The shape of an enzyme is vital for its function and work optimally at a specific temperature and pH, with high temperatures and differing pH levels denaturing it, changing the shape of the active site
3. Some enzymes work outside cells, such as digestive enzymes, which are produced by specialised cells in glands and the lining of the gut, passing out of the cells into the gut, where they come into contact with food molecules and catalyse the breakdown of large molecules into small molecules
