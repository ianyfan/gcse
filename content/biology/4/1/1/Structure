1. The lungs are in the upper part of the body, known as the thorax, protected by the ribcage and separated from the lower part of the body, known as the abdomen, by the diaphragm
2. Air enters through the mouth and into the trachea, which splits into two bronchi, one for each lung, which in turn split into several bronchioles and terminating in alveoli
3. The intercostal muscles are several muscles between the ribs that aid in breathing
