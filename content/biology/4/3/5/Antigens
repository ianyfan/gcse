1. Antigens are proteins on the surface of cells that identify the cell
2. ###Organ transplant
 1. In organ transplants, a diseased organ is replaced with a healthy one from a donor
 2. The recipient's antibodies may attack the antigens on the donor organ as they do not recognise them as part of the recipient's body
 3. To prevent rejection, a donor organ with a "tissue-type" similar to that of the recipient is used and the recipient is treated with drugs that suppress their immune system

3. ###Blood group
 1. There are four main type of human blood, which correspond with the antigens on the red blood cells and the antibodies in the plasma
        |Blood group|Antigen on red blood cell|Antibody in plasma|
        |:---------:|:-----------------------:|:----------------:|
        |     A     |            A            |      Anti-B      |
        |     B     |            B            |      Anti-A      |
        |    AB     |          A & B          |       None       |
        |     O     |          None           | Anti-A & Anti-B  |

 2. In blood transfusions, it is essential that the antigens on the donor red blood cells are not the same letter as the antibodies in the recipient's plasma otherwise they will react, causing agglutination, which can be fatal
 3. Therefore, the ABO compatibility table is used to determine whether a blood transfusion will be successful
