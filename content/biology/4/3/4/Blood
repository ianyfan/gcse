1. Blood is a tissue consisting of a fluid called plasma, in which the white blood cells, platelets and red blood cells are suspended:
    |    Component    |Properties|
    |:---------------:|:---------|
    |     Plasma      |Transport carbon dioxide from the organs to the lungs<br>Transport soluble products of digestion from the small intestine to other organs<br>Transport urea from the liver to the kidneys|
    | Red blood cells |Have no nucleus<br>Transport oxygen from the lungs to the organs<br>Are packed with a red pigment known as haemoglobin<br>In the lungs, haemoglobin combines with oxygen to form oxyhaemoglobin<br>In the organs, oxyhaemoglobin splits up into haemoglobin and oxygen|
    |White blood cells|Have a nucleus<br>Form part of the body's defence system against microorganism|
    |    Platelets    |Are small fragments of cells<br>Have no nucleus<br>Help blood clot at the site of a wound|

2. Blood clotting is a series of enzyme-controlled reactions that convert fibrinogen into fibrin, forming a network of fibres that trap blood cells, forming a clot
