1. ###Structure
 1. The heart is an organ that pumps blood around the body
 2. Much of the wall of the heart is made of muscular tissue
 3. The heart has four main chambers: the left & right atria & ventricles
 4. Pacemaker cells are a group of cells that control the natural resting heart rate

2. ###Action
 1. Blood enters the atria of the heart
 2. The atria contract, forcing blood into the ventricles
 3. The ventricles contract, forcing blood out of the heart
 4. Valves in the heart ensures that blood flows in the correct direction
