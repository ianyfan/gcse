1. During exercise, the body needs to react to the increased demand for energy, so changes occur to increase the supply of glucose and oxygen to, and the rate of removal of carbon dioxide from, the muscles
2. ###Changes
 1. Increase in heart rate, and therefore blood flow to the muscles
 2. Increase of rate & depth of breathing
 3. Glycogen stored in the muscles is converted to glucose

3. ###Fatigue
 1. During long periods of vigorous activity, muscles become fatigued and stop contracting efficiently
 2. One cause of muscle fatigue is the build-up of lactic acid in the muscle
 3. Blood flowing through the muscle eventually removes the lactic acid
