1. Body temperature is monitored & controlled by the thermoregulatory centre in the brain, the hypothalamus, which has receptors sensitive to the temperature of the blood flowing through the brain
2. Temperature receptors in the skin sends information about skin temperature to the hypothalamus
3. Sweating helps cool the body but more water is lost when it is hot so more fluid must be taken through drink of food to balance this
4. ###High temperature
 1. Blood vessels supplying skin capillaries dilate so that more blood flows through the capillaries and more heat is lost
 2. Sweat glands release more sweat, which cools the body as it evaporates

5. ###Low temperature
 1. Blood vessels supplying skin capillaries constrict so that less blood flows through them
 2. Muscles may "shiver", and their contraction requires respiration, which produces some heat to warm the body
