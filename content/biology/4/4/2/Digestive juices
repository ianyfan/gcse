|    Substance    |Production location|Role|
|:---------------:|:-----------------:|:--:|
|     Amylase     |Salivary glands<br>Pancreas<br>Small intestine|Catalyses the breakdown of starch into sugars in the mouth and small intestine|
|    Protease     |Stomach<br>Pancreas<br>Small intestine|Catalyses the breakdown of proteins into amino acids in the stomach and small intestine|
|     Lipase      |Pancreas<br>Small intestine|Catalyses the breakdown of lipids into fatty acids and glycerol in the small intestine|
|Hydrochloric acid|Stomach|Provides an acidic environment where enzymes in the stomach work most effectively|
|      Bile       |Liver; stored in the gallbladder; released ino the small intestine|Provides an alkaline environment where enzymes in the small intestine work most effectively<br>Emulsifies fats, increasing the surface area for lipase to act on|
