1. ###Brain
 1. The brain controls complex behaviours and is made of billions of interconnected neurons with different regions carrying out different functions
 2. The cerebral cortex is associated with consciousness, intelligence, memory and language
 3. The cerebellum is associated mainly with the coordination of muscular activity
 4. The medulla is associated with unconscious activities such as heartbeat and breathing
 5. Scientists have been able to map the regions of the brain to particular functions by studying patients with brain damage, electrically stimulating different parts of the brain and using MRI scanning techniques
