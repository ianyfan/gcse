1. The nervous system enables humans to react to their surrounding and coordinate behaviour
2. Information from receptors passes along neurons as impulses and to the central nervous system, either the brain or the spinal cord
3. The brain coordinates the response and an impulse is sent to an effector, which includes muscles and glands
4. A nervous response can usually be analysed in terms of: stimulus → effector → response

5. ###Reflex actions
 1. Reflex actions are automatic and rapid
 2. They often involve sensory, relay and motor neurons

 3. ####Mechanism
        1. Impulses from a receptor pass along a sensory neuron to the central nervous system
        2. At the synapse between a sensory and a relay neuron in the central nervous system, a neurotransmitter is released that causes an impulse to be sent along the relay neuron
        3. At the synapse between the relay and a motor neuron in the central nervous system, a neurotransmitter is released that causes an impulse to be sent along the motor neuron
        4. The effector is either muscle or a gland, which responds by contracting and secreting chemical substances respectively
