1. ###Inside the body

    1. Enzymes are biological catalysts, which increase the rate of chemical reactions
    2. The shape of an enzyme is vital for its function and work optimally at a specific temperature and pH, with high temperatures and differing pH levels denaturing it, changing the shape of the active site
    3. Some enzymes work outside cells, such as digestive enzymes, which are produced by specialised cells in glands and the lining of the gut, passing out of the cells into the gut, where they come into contact with food molecules and catalyse the breakdown of large molecules into small molecules
2. ###Outside the body

    1. Some microorganisms produce enzymes that pass out of the cells and these have many uses in the home and in industry
    2. ####In the home

        1. Biological detergent may contain proteases and lipases
        2. They are more effective at low temperatures than other detergents
    3. ####In industry

        1. Proteases are used to "pre-digest" the protein in some baby foods
        2. Carbohydrases are used to convert starch into sugar syrup
        3. Isomerases are used to convert glucose syrup into fructose syrup, which is much sweeter and can therefore be used in smaller quantities in slimming foods
