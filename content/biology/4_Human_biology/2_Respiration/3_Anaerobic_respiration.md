1. If insufficient oxygen reaches the muscles, energy is produced by anaerobic respiration: [[C^6^H^12^O^6(aq)^ → 2C^3^H^6^O^3(aq)^ (+ energy)]]
2. It is the incomplete breakdown of glucose, causing a build-up of lactic acid
3. An oxygen debt needs to be repaid to oxidise the lactic acid: [[2C^3^H^6^O^3(aq)^ → 3CO^2^ + 3H^2^O^l^]]
4. Because the breakdown of glucose is incomplete, much less energy is released by anaerobic respiration than by aerobic respiration: about five percent
5. Anaerobic respiration in plant cells and some microorganisms production ethanol and carbon dioxide: [[C^6^H^12^O^6(aq)^ → 2 C^2^H^5^OH^(aq)^ + 2CO^2(g)^ (+ energy)]]
