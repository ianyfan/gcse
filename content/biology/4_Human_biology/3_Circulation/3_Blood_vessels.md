1. ###Structure
 1. Blood flows from the heart to the organs through the arteries and returns through veins
 2. Arteries have thick walls containing muscle and elastic fibres
 3. Veins have thinner walls and often valves to prevent backflow of blood
 4. Capillaries are thin-walled blood vessels in organs where, through the walls, substances needed by the cells pass out of the bloodstream and substances produced by the cells pass into the bloodstream

2. ###Blood vessels around the heart
 1. The aorta is the artery that carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to the rest of the body
 2. The venae cavae are two veins that carry deoxygenated blood to the right atrium from the rest of the body: the superior vena cava, from the upper half of the body, and the inferior vena cava, from the lower half of the body
 3. The pulmonary artery is the artery that carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs
 4. The pulmonary veins are four veins that carries oxygenated blood to the left atrium from the lungs: two from each lung
