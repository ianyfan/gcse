1. ###Pacemakers

    1. Artificial pacemakers are electrical devices used to correct irregularities in heart rate
2. ###Valves

    1. Heart valves can become faulty in two main ways: the valve tissues can stiffen, preventing the valve from opening fully, or the heart valve can develop a leak
    2. Faulty heart valves can be replaced with biological or mechanical ones
3. ###Heart

    1. Artificial hearts are occasionally used to keep patients alive whilst waiting for a heart transplant or to allow the heart to rest as an aid to recovery
4. ###Coronary arteries

    1. In coronary heart disease, a buildup of fatty material narrow the arteries
    2. This reduces blood flow through them, causing a lack of oxygen for the heart muscle
    3. Stents are used to keep the arteries open
