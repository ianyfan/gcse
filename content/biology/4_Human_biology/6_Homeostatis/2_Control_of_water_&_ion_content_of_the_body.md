1. Water leaves the body via the lungs during exhalation and skin during sweating
2. Urea and ions are lost via the skin during sweating
3. Excess water and ions are removed via the kidneys in urine
4. ###In the liver
 1. Excess amino acids are deaminated into ammonia and passed to the kidneys
 2. Poisonous substances are detoxified, and the breakdown products are passed to the kidneys
 3. Old blood cells are broken down and the iron is stored

5. ###In the kidney
 1. The blood is filtered
 2. All the glucose is reabsorbed
 3. Dissolved ions needed by the body are reabsorbed
 4. Water needed by the body is reabsorbed
 5. Urea and excess ions & water are released as urine

6. ###ADH
 1. If the water content of the blood is too low, the pituitary gland releases a hormone called ADH into the bloodstream, causing the kidneys to reabsorb more water and resulting in a more concentrated urine
 2. If the water content of the blood is too high, less ADH is released, causing the kidneys to reabsorb less water and resulting in a more dilute urine

7. ###Kidney replacement
 1. People who suffer from renal failure may be treated by kidney transplant or dialysis
 2. Dialysis restores the concentrations of dissolved substances in the blood to normal levels through regular use of a dialysis machine
 3. In a dialysis machine, the person's blood flows between partially permeable membranes, opposite dialysis fluid, which contains the same concentration of dissolved substances as the blood of a person without renal disease, so that the concentration of dissolved substances in the person's blood returns to normal levels through diffusion
 4. Transplant or dialysis:
 
    |Transplant|Dialysis|
    |:--------:|:------:|
    |The patient does not have to be attached to a machine every few days|Treatment before and following the transplant involves suppressing the patient's immune system, which leaves them vulnerable to common infection|
