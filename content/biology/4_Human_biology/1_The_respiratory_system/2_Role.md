1. The respiratory system takes air into and out of the body so that oxygen from the air can diffuse into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide can diffuse out of the bloodstream into the air
2. ###Inhalation
 1. The intercostal muscles contract, pulling the rib cage down
 2. At the same time, the diaphragm muscles contract, causing the diaphragm to flatten
 3. These two movements cause an increase in volume of the thorax
 4. The consequent decrease in pressure to below that of the surrounding air causing air to enter the lungs

3. ###Exhalation
 1. The intercostal muscles relax, allowing the rib cage to move up
 2. At the same time, the diaphragm muscles relax, allowing the diaphragm to resume its domed shape
 3. These two movements cause a decrease in volume of the thorax
 4. The consequent increase in pressure to above that of the surrounding air causes air to leave the lungs
