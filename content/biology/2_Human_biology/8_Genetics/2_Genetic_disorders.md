1. ###Genetic disorders

    1. Some disorders are inherited
    2. ###Allele disorders

        1. Polydactyly, having extra fingers or toes, is caused by a dominant allele and can therefore by passed on by only one parent who has the disorder
        2. Cystic fibrosis, a disorder of cell membranes, is caused by a recessive allele and must therefore be inherited by both parents, who can carry the disorder without actually have the disorder themselves
        3. Sickle-cell anaemia, a disorder affecting red blood cells, is caused by a recessive allele
        4. People who are heterozygous for the sickle-cell anaemia gene are less likely to get malaria than those who are homozygous for the dominant gene
    3. Some inherited conditions are caused by inheritance of abnormal numbers of chromosomes, such as Down syndrome, which is caused by the presence of an extra chromosome
2. ###Embryo screening

    1. Embryos can be screened for the alleles that cause many genetic disorders
    2. ####Mechanism

        1. DNA is isolated from embryo cells
        2. A gene probe that will bind onto the gene for a specific disorder is produced, typically with a fluorescent chemical attached
        3. The probe is added to a mixture containing the DNA sample from the embryo
        4. UV light is used to detect the probe attached to the gene for the disorder
    3. ####Concerns

        1. The risk of miscarriages
        2. The reliability of the information from the screening procedure
        3. Decisions about terminating pregnancy
