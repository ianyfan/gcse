1. ###Role

    1. Respiration in cells produces energy aerobically or anaerobically
    2. ####Uses of energy

        1. To build larger molecules from smaller ones
        2. In animals: to enable muscles to contract
        3. In mammals and birds: to maintain a steady body temperature in colder surroundings
        4. In plants: to build up sugars, nitrates and other nutrients into amino acids, which are then built up into proteins
2. ###Aerobic respiration

    1. Aerobic respiration is a series of chemical reactions that use glucose & oxygen to produce energy: [[C^6^H^12^O^6 (aq)^ + 6O^2 (g)^ → 6CO^2^ + 6H^2^O^(l)^ (+ energy)]]
    2. Most of the reactions occur inside mitochondria
    3. Aerobic respiration occurs continuously in plants and animals
3. ###Anaerobic respiration

    1. Anaerobic respiration occurs if insufficient oxygen reaches the muscles: [[C^6^H^12^O^6 (aq)^ → 2C^3^H^6^O^3 (aq)^ (+ energy)]]
    2. It is the incomplete breakdown of glucose, causing a build-up of lactic acid
    3. An oxygen debt needs to be repaid to oxidise the lactic acid: [[2C^3^H^6^O^3 (aq)^ 3O^2 (g)^ → 3CO^2^ + 3H^2^O^(l)^]]
    4. The breakdown of glucose is incomplete so much less energy is released by anaerobic respiration than by aerobic respiration[^anaerobic]
    5. Anaerobic respiration in plant cells and some microorganisms produce ethanol and carbon dioxide: [[C^6^H^12^O^6 (aq)^ → 2 C^2^H^5^OH^(aq)^ + 2CO^2 (g)^ (+ energy)]]
4. ###Exercise

    1. During exercise, the body reacts to the increased demand for energy by causing changes that increase the supply of glucose and oxygen to, and the rate of removal of carbon dioxide from, the muscles
    2. ####Changes

        1. Increase in heart rate, and therefore blood flow to the muscles
        2. Increase of rate & depth of breathing
        3. Glycogen stored in the muscles is converted to glucose
    3. ####Fatigue

        1. During long periods of vigorous activity, muscles become fatigued and stop contracting efficiently
        2. One cause of muscle fatigue is the build-up of lactic acid in the muscle
        3. Blood flowing through the muscle eventually removes the lactic acid



[^anaerobic]: About 5%
