1. Plants display responses to light, moisture and gravity, which are called phototropism, hydrotropism and gravitropism respectively
2. Their shoots grow towards light and against the force of gravity
3. Their roots grow towards moisture and the force of gravity
4. Plants produce hormones to coordinate and control growth, such as auxin, which controls phototropism and gravitropism
5. The responses of roots and shoots to light, gravity and moisture are the result of unequal distribution of auxin, causing unequal growth rates[^auxin]
6. Plant growth hormones are used in agriculture & horticulture as herbicides, rooting hormones for cuttings and to ripen fruit



[^auxin]: Auxin on the roots inhibits growth on the lower side to make it curve downwards, called positive gravitropism, and auxin on the stems increases growth on the lower side to make it curve upwards, called negative gravitropism
