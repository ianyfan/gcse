1. Tumours result from the abnormal uncontrolled division of cells
2. Benign tumours do not invade other tissues but can be dangerous if they grow in tissues such as those in the brain and compress it
3. Cells from malignant tumours invade healthy tissue and may enter the bloodstream and circulate to other parts of the body, forming secondary tumours
4. Tumours can be caused by chemical carcinogens, such as those found in tobacco smoke in asbestos, and by ionising radiation, such as UV and X-rays
