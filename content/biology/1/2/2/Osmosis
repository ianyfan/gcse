1. Osmosis is the diffusion of water from a less concentrated to more concentrated solution through a partially permeable membrane that allows the passage of water molecules
2. The difference in concentration of the solutions inside and outside a cell cause water to move into or out of it by osmosis
3. If the two solutions have the same concentration, they are isotonic
4. The solution that is more concentrated is hypertonic
5. The solution that is more dilute is hypotonic
6. Turgor is pressure that pushes the cell membrane of a plant cell against the cell wall
7. Plasmolysis occurs when plant cells are placed in hypertonic solutions and a lot of water leaves the cell, causing the cell membranes collapse
