1. Diffusion is the spread of particles of a gas or substance in solution, resulting in a net movement from a region where they are of a higher concentration to a region where they are of a lower concentration
2. The greater the difference in concentration, the faster the rate of diffusion
3. Dissolved substances and oxygen can move through the cell membrane by diffusion
