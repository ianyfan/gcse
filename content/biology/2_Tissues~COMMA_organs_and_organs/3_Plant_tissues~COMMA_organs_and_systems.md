1. Plant organs include stems, roots and leaves
2. ###Leaf

    1. Leaves have a large surface to maximise photosynthesising potential, and thin so that gases have less distance to diffuse
    2. At the top is a waxy cuticle, which prevents water loss by transpiration
    3. Below that is the epidermis, a layer of epidermal tissue; both are thin and transparent to allow maximum light to pass through
    4. Below that is the palisade layer, a layer of palisade mesophyll tissue packed tightly with tall, thin palisade cells containing many chloroplasts, and therefore chlorophyll, to maximise photosynthesising potential
    5. Below that is the spongy layer, a loyer of spongy mesophyll, which has more spread out cells and air spaces to maximise surface area for gas exchange
    6. Below that, the epidermis contains stomata, pores that are controlled by guard cells, opening to let gas through and closing to prevent water loss
3. ###Transport

    1. Xylem & phloem are tissues that transport substances around the plant
    2. Xylem transport water with some dissolved nutrients & minerals from the roots to the leaves
    3. Phloem transport sugar and other substances formed by photosynthesis in a sap from the leaves to the rest of the plant
    4. Xylem are mainly composed of dead cells; phloem are composed of living cells
    5. In the leaf, the vascular tissue is located in the network of veins
    6. In the stem, the vascular tissue is located in bundles near the edge to resist compression and bending forces
    7. In the roots, the vascular tissue is located in the centre to withstand stretching forces
    8. Xylem are generally located nearer the interior than the phloem
