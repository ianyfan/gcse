1. ###Causes
 1. Rapid growth in the human population
 2. An increase in the standard of living
 3. Improper handling of waste

2. ###Effects
 1. Water is polluted with sewage, fertiliser or toxic chemicals
 2. Air is polluted with smoke & gases such as sulfur dioxide, which may be washed from land into water
 3. Sewage and fertilisers may cause eutrophication:
     1. An increase in the concentration of mineral ions in the water stimulates the growth of algae or plants
     2. Eventually the growth results in some being unable to receive sufficient light for photosynthesis and dying
     3. There is a large increase in the population of microorganisms that feed on these dead organisms
     4. The respiration of the microorganisms depletes the oxygen concentration in the water, leading to the death of aerobic organisms
