1. Quadrats are used to provide a random sample to estimate a population size
2. Transects are used to show the change in distribution on a line between two points using regular quadrat measurements along it
3. Sample size is related to validity, reproducibility and repeatability, since if sample size is too small, it may not be representative, so the larger the sample size, the more trustworthy it is
