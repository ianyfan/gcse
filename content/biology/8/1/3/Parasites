1. Parasites are adapted for living on or inside their hosts
2. ###Fleas
 1. Fleas live amongst the hair of mammals
 2. They have sharp mouthparts to enable them to suck blood
 3. Their body is flattened so they are not easily dislodged
 4. Their body is hard so they are not damaged when the mammal scratches
 5. Their hind legs are long so they can jump from host to host

3. ###Tapeworm
 1. Tapeworms live in the intestines of animals
 2. They have suckers and hooks to fix themselves to the wall of the intestine
 3. Their body consists of flattened segments, which mainly produce many eggs
 4. They have no gut and their flattened shape provides a large surface area for the absorption of soluble food from the host gut
 5. They have a thick outer cuticle to protect them from the host's digestive enzymes

4. ###Malaria parasites
 1. These are single-celled organisms that cause malaria in humans and have different forms that are specialised for living in a different place
 2. Gametocytes infect mosquitoes when the mosquito sucks blood containing them, and pass into the salivary glands, where they reproduce sexually and develop into sporozoites
 3. Sporozoites are passed onto humans when the mosquito bites and injects its saliva into the blood vessels, and travel with the blood to the liver and enter the liver cells, where some divide and become thousands of merozoites
 4. Merozoites are released from the liver and into the blood, where they enter the red blood cells and some turn into schizonts
 5. Schizonts burst the red blood cells, releasing more merozoites; this release coincides with the fever attack seen when a person has malaria
 6. Some merozoites in the blood cells enter a sexual phase of reproduction and produce female gametocytes, which can be transferred to the mosquito when it bites
