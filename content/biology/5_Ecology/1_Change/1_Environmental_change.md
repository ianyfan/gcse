1. Changes in the environment affect the distribution of living organisms
2. ###Factors

    1. Change in numbers or types of competitor
    2. Temperature
    3. Amount of light
    4. Availability of nutrients
    5. Availability of water
    6. Availability of oxygen & carbon dioxide
    7. Availability of nesting sites, shelter and appropriate habitats
3. ###Impacts

    1. Birds may fly further north if the climate gets warmer, introducing new competition
    2. The fall in bee population may have been caused by several factors, such as the use of chemical spray by farmers, a viral disease, and changes in the flowering patterns of plants that may be due to climate change
