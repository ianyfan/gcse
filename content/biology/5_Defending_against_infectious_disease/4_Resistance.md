1. ###Mechanism

    1. Mutations of pathogens produce new strains
    2. Antibiotics destroy individual bacteria of the non-resistant strain but resistant bacteria survive and reproduce, so the population of the resistant strain rises
    3. Antibiotics and vaccinations may no longer be effective against a new resistant strain of the bacteria
    4. The new strain will then spread rapidly because people are not immune to it and there is no effective treatment
    5. Many strains of bacteria, including MRSA, have developed resistance to antibiotics
    6. Overuse and inappropriate use of antibiotics has increased the rate of development of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria
2. ###Defence

    1. Antibiotics are not currently used to treat non-serious infections, such as mild throat infections, in order to slow the rate of development of resistant strains
    2. The development of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria necessitates the development of new antibiotics
3. ###Cultures

    1. Uncontaminated cultures of microorganisms are required for investigating the action of disinfectants and antibiotics
    2. For this, petri dishes and culture media must be sterilised before use to destroy unwanted microorganisms
    3. Inoculating loops used to transfer microorganisms to the media must be sterilised by passing them through a flame
    4. The lid of the petri dish should be secured with adhesive tape to prevent microorganisms from the air contaminating the culture, and stored upside-down to stop bacteria falling onto the agar surface
    5. In school and college laboratories, cultures should be incubated at a maximum temperature of 25 Â°C to greatly reduce the likelihood of the growth of pathogens that might be harmful to humans
    6. In industrial conditions, higher temperatures can produce more rapid growth
