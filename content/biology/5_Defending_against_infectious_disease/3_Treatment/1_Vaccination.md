1. People can be immunised against an infectious disease by introducing small quantities of dead or inactive forms of the pathogen into the body
2. Vaccines stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies that destroy the pathogen
3. This makes the person immune to future infections by the pathogen since the immune system can rapidly make the correct antibody, as if the person had previously had the disease
4. The MMR vaccine is used to protect children against measles, mumps and rubella
