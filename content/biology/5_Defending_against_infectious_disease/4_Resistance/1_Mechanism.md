1. Mutations of pathogens produce new strains
2. Antibiotics destroy individual bacteria of the non-resistant strain but resistant bacteria survive and reproduce, so the population of the resistant strain rises
3. Antibiotics and vaccinations may no longer be effective against a new resistant strain of the bacteria
4. The new strain will then spread rapidly because people are not immune to it and there is no effective treatment
5. Many strains of bacteria, including MRSA, have developed resistance to antibiotics
6. Overuse and inappropriate use of antibiotics has increased the rate of development of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria
