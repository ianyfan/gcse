1. A single-celled organism has a relatively-high surface area to volume ratio and all the necessary exchanges occur via its membrane
2. The size and complexity of an organism increase the difficulty of exchanging materials and in multicellular organisms, many organ systems are specialised for exchanging materials
3. Gas and solute exchange surfaces in organisms are adapted to maximise effectiveness
4. ###Factors increasing the effectiveness of an exchange surface
 1. Having a large surface area that is thin to provide a short diffusion path
 2. In animals: having an efficient blood supply
 3. For gaseous exchange in animals: having good ventilation

5. ###Examples
 1. The small intestine is lined with villi, which forms a large thin-walled surface area and a rich blood supply that maintains a steep concentration gradient for efficient diffusion
 2. Lungs absorb oxygen through alveoli, which form a large surface area with a rich blood supply to carry the oxygen away and maintain a concentration gradient
 3. Plant roots are long and thin to increase the surface area for water absorption and root hair cells increase the surface area further
 4. Plant leaves are flat and thin with internal air spaces and stomata to allow gases in and out of the leaves
