1. Most types of animal cells differentiate at an early stage whereas many plant cells retain the ability to differentiate throughout life
2. In mature animals, cell division is mainly restricted to reparation and replacement
3. Stem cells from human embryos and adult bone marrow can be made to differentiate into many different types of human cells
4. In therapeutic cloning, an embryo is produced with the same genes as the patient and since stem cells from the embryo will not be rejected by the patient's body, they can be used for medical treatment
5. Treatment with stem cells may be able to help conditions such as paralysis by differentiating stem cells into new nerve cells
