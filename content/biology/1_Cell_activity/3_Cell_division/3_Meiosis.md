1. Cells in reproductive organs divide to form gametes by meiosis
2. When a cell divides by meiosis, a copy of the genetic material is made and the cell divides twice to form four gametes, each with a single set of chromosomes
3. Gametes join at fertilisation to form a single cell with new pairs of chromosomes, and repeatedly divides by mitosis to form many cells and as an organism develops, these cells differentiate to form different types of cells
