1. ###Chromosomes

    1. The nucleus of a cell contains chromosomes, which carry many genes that control the characteristics of the body
    2. Many genes have different forms called alleles, which may produce different characteristics
    3. In cells, chromosomes are normally found in pairs
2. ###Mitosis

    1. Body cells divide by mitosis to produce replacement cells or additional cells during growth
    2. When a cell divides by mitosis, a copy of the genetic material is made and the cell divides once to form two genetically identical cells
3. ###Meiosis

    1. Cells in reproductive organs divide to form gametes by meiosis
    2. When a cell divides by meiosis, a copy of the genetic material is made and the cell divides twice to form four gametes, each with a single set of chromosomes
    3. Gametes join at fertilisation to form a single cell with new pairs of chromosomes, and repeatedly divides by mitosis to form many cells and as an organism develops, these cells differentiate to form different types of cells
4. ###Stem cells

    1. Most types of animal cells differentiate at an early stage whereas many plant cells retain the ability to differentiate throughout life
    2. In mature animals, cell division is mainly restricted to reparation and replacement
    3. Stem cells from human embryos and adult bone marrow can be made to differentiate into many different types of human cells
    4. In therapeutic cloning, an embryo is produced with the same genes as the patient and since stem cells from the embryo will not be rejected by the patient's body, they can be used for medical treatment
    5. Treatment with stem cells may be able to help conditions such as paralysis by differentiating stem cells into new nerve cells
5. ###Tumours

    1. Tumours result from the abnormal uncontrolled division of cells
    2. Benign tumours do not invade other tissues but can be dangerous if they grow in tissues such as those in the brain and compress it
    3. Cells from malignant tumours invade healthy tissue and may enter the bloodstream and circulate to other parts of the body, forming secondary tumours
    4. Tumours can be caused by chemical carcinogens, such as those found in tobacco smoke in asbestos, and by ionising radiation, such as UV and X-rays
