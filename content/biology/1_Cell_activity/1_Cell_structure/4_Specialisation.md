1. Cells may be specialised for a particular function, and this affects their structure
2. Cells with many mitochondria need a lot of energy, such as muscle cells
3. Cells with many ribosomes must make a lot of proteins, such as gland cells, which make enzymes
4. Sperm cells have many mitochondria and a tail, since they require a lot of energy and swim
5. Receptor cells have special structure that enable them to detect stimuli, such as cone cells, in the eye, which are light sensitive and specialised to connect to the optic nerve
6. Mesophyll cells of a leaf have many chloroplasts for photosynthesis
7. Root hair cells increase the surface area of a root so that it can absorb water and mineral ions efficiently
