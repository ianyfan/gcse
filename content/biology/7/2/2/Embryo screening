1. Embryos can be screened for the alleles that cause many genetic disorders
2. ###Mechanism
 1. DNA is isolated from embryo cells
 2. A gene probe that will bind onto the gene for a specific disorder is produced, usually with a fluorescent chemical attached
 3. The probe is added to a mixture containing the DNA sample from the embryo
 4. UV light is used to detect the probe attached to the gene for the disorder

3. ###Concerns
 1. The risk of miscarriages
 2. The reliability of the information from the screening procedure
 3. Decisions about terminating pregnancy
