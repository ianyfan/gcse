1. ###Efficiency

    1. The efficiency of food production can be improved by reducing the number of stages in a food chain
    2. Efficiency can also be improved by restricting energy loss from food animals by limiting their movement and by controlling the temperature of their surroundings; however, this is controversial since it is seen by many people to be cruel
    3. Efficiency also depends on the fuel consumed to transport it
2. ###Fish stocks

    1. Fish stocks in the oceans are declining
    2. It is important to maintain fish stocks at a level where breeding continues, otherwise certain species may disappear altogether in some areas
