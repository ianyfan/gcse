1. They ingest pathogens
2. They produce antibodies, which are unique in destroying particular bacteria or viruses, leading to immunity from that pathogen
3. They produce antitoxins, which counteract the toxins produced by bacteria
4. If a large proportion of a population is immune to a pathogen, the spread of the pathogen is greatly reduced, effecting "herd immunity"
