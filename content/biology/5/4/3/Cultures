1. Uncontaminated cultures of microorganisms are required for investigating the action of disinfectants and antibiotics
2. For this, petri dishes and culture media must be sterilised before use to destroy unwanted microorganisms
3. Inoculating loops used to transfer microorganisms to the media must be sterilised by passing them through a flame
4. The lid of the petri dish should be secured with adhesive tape to prevent microorganisms from the air contaminating the culture, and stored upside-down to stop bacteria falling onto the agar surface
5. In school and college laboratories, cultures should be incubated at a moximum temperature of 25 Â°C to greatly reduce the likelihood of the growth of pathogens that might be harmful to humans
6. In industrial conditions, higher temperatures can poduce more rapid growth
