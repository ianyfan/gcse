1. Differences in the characteristics of organisms of the same kind may be due to genetic & environmental causes
2. The information that results in organisms have similar characteristics to their parents is carried by genes, which are passed on in gametes
3. Different genes control the development of different characteristics of an organism
4. ###Alleles
 1. Some characteristics are controlled by a single gene, and forms of that gene are called alleles
 2. If both chromosomes in a pair contain the same allele of a gene, the individual is homozygous for that gene, and if they contain different alleles, the individual is heterozygous for that gene
 3. An allele that controls the development of a characteristic whenever it is present is called a dominant allele
 4. An allele that controls the development of a characteristic only if the dominant allele is not present is called a recessive allele

5. ###Reproduction
 1. Sexual reproduction is the fusion of male and female gametes and the mixture of the genetic information from the two parents leads to variety in the offspring
 2. Asexual reproduction only needs one individual as the parent but since there is no fusion of gametes, there is no mixing of genetic information and so no variety in the offspring, which are therefore known as clones
