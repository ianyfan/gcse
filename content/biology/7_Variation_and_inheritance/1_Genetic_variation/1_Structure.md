1. The nucleus of a cell contains chromosomes, and in a human, there are normally 23 pairs
2. Chromosomes are made of large molecules of DNA, which contains the coded information that determines inherited characteristics
3. DNA is made of very long strands, twisted in the form of a double helix, which contain four different compounds called bases
4. Any sequence of three bases is the code for a particular amino acid, and the order of bases determines the order in which amino acids are assembled to form a particular protein
5. A gene is a small section of DNA, and each gene codes for a particular protein
