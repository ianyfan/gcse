    |Cloning cattle can produce herds of cattle with useful characteristics, especially preserving the best animals|Concerns about using the technique to clone humans in the future|
2. ###Genetic Engineering

    |Advantages|Disadvantages|
    |:--------:|:-----------:|
    |If a person has a faulty gene, they may have a genetic disorder; if the correct gene can be transferred to the person, they could be cured|Many people worry about the effect of eating GM crops on human health|
    |Several medical drugs have been produced by genetic engineering, such as insulin and antibodies|Some people are concerned about accidentally introducing genes into wild flower populations|
    |Genetically modified crops generally show increased yields|Farmers have to buy new GM seed every year because the crops are infertile|
    |Genetically crops can be resistant to insect attack or herbicides|Insects that are not pests can be affected by GM crops|
