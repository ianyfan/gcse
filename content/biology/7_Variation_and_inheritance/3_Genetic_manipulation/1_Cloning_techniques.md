1. Tissue culture uses small groups of cells from part of a plant
2. Embryo transplants split stem cells from a developing animal embryo, then transplant the identical embryos into host mothers

3. ###Adult cell cloning
 1. The nucleus is removed from an unfertilised egg cell and the nucleus from an adult body cell inserted
 2. An electric shock acts as the catalyst for the egg cell to begin dividing to form embryo cells containing the same genetic information as the adult
