1. Some disorders are inherited
2. ###Allele disorders

    1. Polydactyly, having extra fingers or toes, is caused by a dominant allele and can therefore by passed on by only one parent who has the disorder
    2. Cystic fibrosis, a disorder of cell membranes, is caused by a recessive allele and must therefore be inherited by both parents, who can carry the disorder without actually have the disorder themselves
    3. Sickle-cell anaemia, a disorder affecting red blood cells, is caused by a recessive allele
    4. People who are heterozygous for the sickle-cell anaemia gene are less likely to get malaria than those who are homozygous for the dominant gene
3. Some inherited conditions are caused by inheritance of abnormal numbers of chromosomes, such as Down's syndrome, which is caused by the presence of an extra chromosome
