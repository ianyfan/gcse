1. Individual organisms within a particular species may show a wide range of variation because of differences in their genes caused by mutations
2. Individuals with characteristics most suited to the environment are more likely to survive to breed successfully
3. The genes that have enabled these individuals to survive are then passed on to the next generation
4. Evolution of a new species can take millions of years but sometimes evolution of a population occurs in a relatively short time, such as antibiotic resistance in bacteria
