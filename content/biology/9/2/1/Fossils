1. Evidence of early forms of life comes from fossils
2. Fossils are the "remains" of organisms from hundreds of thousands of years ago that are found in rocks
3. ###Formation origins
 1. From parts of organisms that have not decayed because one or mare of the conditions required for decay are absent
 2. When parts of the organism are replaced by other materials as the decay
 3. As preserved traces of organisms, such as footprints, burrows and rootlet traces

4. Many early forms of life were soft-bodied, which means that they have left few traces behind, which were mostly destroyed by ge; this is why scientists cannot be certain about how life began on Earth
5. Fossils show how much or how little different organisms have changed as life developed on Earth
