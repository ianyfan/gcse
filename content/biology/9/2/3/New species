1. ###Mechanism

 1. Isolation: two populations of a species become separated, such as by geographical isolation
 2. Genetic variation: each population has a wide range of allels that control their characteristics
 3. Natural selection: in each population, the alleles that control the characteristics that help to organism to survive are selected
 4. Speciation: the populations become so different that successful interbreeding is no longer possible
