1. Male & female gametes are produced
2. The anther produces the male gametes in pollen grains, which are transferred to the female ovules in a process called pollination
3. The pollen grains attach to the stigma on top of the carpel, in which the ovules are located
4. A pollen tube grow through the carpel's style into ovule
5. The nuclei from the pollen grain migrate into the ovule to fertilise the egg cell nucleus and endosperm nuclei
6. The resulting zygote develops into an embryo
7. The endosperm and the female tissues of the ovule give rise to seed
8. The ovary then grows into a fruit, which surrounds the seed
