1. Plants display responses to light, moisture and gravity, which are called phototropism, hydrotropism and gravitropism respectively
2. Their shoots grow towards light and against the force of gravity
3. Their roots grow towards moisture and the force of gravity
4. Plants produce hormones to coordinate and control growth, such as auxin, which controls phototropism and gravitropism
5. The responses of roots and shoots to light, gravity and moisture are the result of unequal distribution or auxin, causing unequal growth rates
6. Plant growth hormones are used in agriculture and horticulture as weed killers and rooting hormones
