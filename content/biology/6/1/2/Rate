1. ###Limiting factors
 1. Low temperature, since enzymes do not work optimally
 2. Shortage of carbon dioxide
 3. Shortage of light
 4. Lack of chlorophyll

2. In a greenhouse, temperature, carbon dioxide concentration and light intensity are enhanced to ensure optimum photosynthesising conditions
