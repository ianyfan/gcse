1. ###Physical attributes

    1. Sound is produced by vibrating sources that cause the surrounding medium to vibrate accordingly
    2. Sound is a longitudinal wave
    3. An area where particles are compressed together is called a compression
    4. An area where particles are far apart is called a rarefaction
    5. A medium is needed to transmit sound waves
2. ###Speed of sound

    1. The speed of sound can be obtained experimentally by timing the echo from a plane a known distance from the sound, and using the formula [[speed of sound = {{: 2â‹…distance to plane :}|{: time to hearing echo :}}]]
    2. The speed of sound in air is lower than in liquids, which is lower than in solids
3. ###Audition

    1. The approximate range of audible frequencies is 20-20,000 Hertz
    2. The loudness of a sound rises with the amplitude of the sound wave
    3. The pitch of a sound wave rises with the frequency of the sound wave
    4. The reflection of sound produces an echo, which can be perceived if it returns with sufficient amplitude and volume
