1. A wave is an oscillation travelling through space and matter that transfers energy
2. A wavefront is the locus of points with the same phase
3. [[v = fλ]] wherein [[v]] denotes the speed, the rate at which the wave propagates through space; [[f]] denotes the frequency, the number of cycles per second; and [[λ]] denotes the wavelength, the length of one cycle
4. Waves can be longitudinal, in the case of sound, or transverse, in the case of light
