1. Water waves can be produced using a ripple tank
2. Reflection at a plane surface can be shown by placing the plane on the surface and sending waves towards it
3. Refraction due to a change of speed can be shown by placing a block below the water, since the speed of the wave depends on the depth of the water
4. Diffraction produced by wide and narrow gaps can be shown by sending waves through a slit on the surface of the water
