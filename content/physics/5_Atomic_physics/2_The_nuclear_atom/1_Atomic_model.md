1. Atoms have a small central nucleus, which is made up of protons and neutrons, around which there are electrons
2. Before this was established, the accepted model was the "plum pudding model" wherein the atom is composed of electrons surrounded by a soup of positive charge; the Geiger-Marsden experiment in 1909 directed a beam of alpha particles normally onto a sheet of very thin gold foil: under the plum pudding model, the particles should all have been scattered only slightly, but while this was mostly the case, a small percentage of particles were deflected back to the source, at angles much greater than 90Â°; This proves that the atoms has a small concentrated centre of positive charge and of relatively large mass, with the electrons situated in the mostly open space around it
