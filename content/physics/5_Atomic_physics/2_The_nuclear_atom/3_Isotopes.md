1. Isotopes of an element are the set of nuclides with the same proton number but different neutron numbers
2. ###Practical applications

 1. Americium-241 is used in smoke detectors by releasing alpha particles that ionise air particles in an ionisation chamber that is connected to an electric circuit, allowing a current to flow: when smoke enters the chamber, the ions attach to the smoke particles, causing the current to drop so an alarm sounds
 2. Uranium-lead dating determines the age of an object by measuring the percentage of 2 Uranium isotopes that have decayed into 2 respective Lead isotopes
 3. Radiocarbon dating determines the age of an object by measuring the percentage of the radioactive Carbon-14 isotope that has decayed
