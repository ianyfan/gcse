1. ###Properties

    1. Magnets produce a magnetic field and attract ferromagnetic objects
    2. The force of attraction is greater at the poles than in the middle
    3. Like poles repel and opposite poles attract
    4. If free to rotate, the north(-seeking) pole rotates to face the north pole, and vice versa
2. ###Induced magnetism

    1. Induced magnetism is when a unmagnetised but magnetic substance becomes magnetised near a magnet
    2. Ferrous & non-ferrous metals describe metals & alloys that do & do not, respectively, contain iron in appreciable amounts
    3. Methods of magnetising a ferromagnet: placing it in a magnetic field, enhanced by vibrating; stroking a magnet along it
    4. Methods of demagnetising a ferromagnet: placing it in a reverse or alternating magnetic field; hammering or jarring
    5. The field lines of a bar magnet can be displayed from the alignment of iron filings dispersed on a piece of paper below which is placed the magnet
    6. Iron and steel can both be used as magnets: iron becomes magnetised faster when induced but loses it immediately upon removal; steel becomes magnetised slower but retains its magnetism
    7. Electromagnets are made from iron and useful since the strength of the magnetic field can be changed rapidly by adjusting the amount of current in the winding
    8. Permanent magnets are made from steel and more useful when there isn't a source of electricity present to induce an electromagnet
