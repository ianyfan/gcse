1. Analogue electronics have a continuous variable signal
2. Digital electronics represent signals that only take two values: one near ground and one near the supply voltage, corresponding to the "false" (0) and "true" (1) values of the boolean domain respectively
3. Logic gates are circuits containing transistors and other components
4. ###Logic gates

    1. [[NOT A]]: if [[A]] is low, [[NOT A]] is high, else, it is low
    2. [[A AND B]]: if [[A]] is low, [[A AND B]] is low, else, it is [[B]]
    3. [[A OR B]]: if [[A]] is high, [[A AND B]] is high, else, it is [[B]]
    4. [[A NAND B]]: if [[A]] is low, [[A NAND B]] is high, else, it is [[NOT B]]
    5. [[A NOR B]]: if [[A]] is high, [[A NOR B]] is high, else, it is [[NOT B]]
