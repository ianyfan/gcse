1. ###The magnetic effect of a current

    1. Passing an electric current through a wire induces a magnetic field around the wire, which goes clockwise around it if looking in the direction of current
    2. With multiple wires, the induced field superpose
    3. In a solenoid, the resultant field goes straight through it (it effectively becomes a bar magnet) and if looking in its direction, the current goes clockwise
    4. The strength of the magnetic field is inversely proportional to the distance from the wire and directly proportional to the magnitude of the current, the number of coils and the presence of an iron core
2. ###Force on a current-carrying conductor

    1. In a magnetic field, a current-carrying conductor perpendicular to the direction of the field experiences a force perpendicular to both, namely the direction in which the magnetic effect of the current counteracts the field
3. ###d.c. motor

    1. In a magnetic field, a current-carrying coil pointing perpendicular to the direction of the field experiences a turning effect in which the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the direction of the field & coil
    2. The magnitude of the turning effect is directly proportional to the magnitude of the current and the number of turns on the coil
    3. This phenomenon can be utilised to create a motor, using slip rings or commutators to provide current from an a.c. or d.c. e.m.f. respectively; commutators are a set of contacts that touch the ends of motor, so that as the motor turns, the ends advance to a different contact and the current in the motor switches direction, allowing it to generate the correct torque to keep turning
