1. ###Molecular structure

    |State |Arrangement of molecules|Force of attraction between molecules|
    |:----:|:----------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|
    |Solid |Held in a rigid lattice |Very strong|
    |Liquid|Held together loosely, but are free to move past each other|Weaker: this allows liquids to flow|
    | Gas  |Free to move, travelling rapidly in a straight line until colliding|None: the large distances between the molecules allow the gas to change volume|
2. ###Kinetic energy

    1. The absolute temperature of a gas is directly proportional to the mean kinetic energy of its molecules
    2. The pressure of a gas is directly proportional to the mean kinetic energy of its molecules
    3. The temperature of a gas is directly proportional to the pressure, at a constant temperature
3. ###Brownian motion

    1. The random motion of molecules in a suspension is evidence for the kinetic molecular model of matter
    2. This is caused by the suspended molecules being constantly bombarded by the molecules in the fluid
    3. Massive molecules can be moved by the constant bombardment from light, fast-moving particles
