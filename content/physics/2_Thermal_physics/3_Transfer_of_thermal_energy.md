1. ###Conduction

    1. Good and bad conductors of heat can be determined by the speed at which heat is transferred through it
    2. Heat is transferred when hotter, and therefore faster-moving, molecules collide with cooler & slower molecules and transfers some of its energy to it
2. ###Convection

    1. Convection in a fluid occurs since hotter fluid is less dense and rises, causing colder fluid to sink, creating a circulation of heat transfer
    2. Convection can be shown by showing the movement of potassium manganate, which colours water purple, in a loop of water heated from the bottom
3. ###Radiation

    1. Radiation is energy emitted by matter as infrared radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum
    2. Good & bad emitters & absorbers of radiation can be shown using a Leslie cube
