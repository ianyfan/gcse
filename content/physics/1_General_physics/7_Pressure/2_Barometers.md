1. Barometers can be used to measure atmospheric pressure
2. A simple mercury barometer works by having a sealed tube of mercury sit upside-down in a reservoir of mercury; the mercury in the tube falls, creating a vacuum at the top, or rises until the weight of the mercury matches atmospheric pressure
