1. A body can have energy due to its motion or its position
2. Energy can be transferred and stored
3. Energy exists in different forms: kinetic, gravitational potential, chemical, strain, nuclear, internal, electrical, light and sound
4. Kinetic energy is equal to [[{{: 1 :}|{: 2 :}}mv^^2^^]] and gravitational energy is equal to [[mgh]]
5. The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system cannot change
