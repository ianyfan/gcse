1. ###Distance/time graphs
 1. A distance/time graph is a graph of distance against time

2. ###Speed/time graphs
 1. A speed/time graph is a graph of speed against time
 2. The speed/time graph of a body at rest is a flat line at zero
 3. The speed/time graph of a body moving with constant speed is a flat non-zero line
 4. The speed/time graph of a body moving with changing speed is a non-flat curve
 5. The speed/time graph of a body with constant acceleration is a linear graph with the gradient of the line equal to the acceleration
 6. The area under a speed/time graph is the distance travelled
