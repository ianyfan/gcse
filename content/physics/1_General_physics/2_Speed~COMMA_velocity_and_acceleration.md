1. ###Speed

    1. Speed is the rate of change in distance
    2. Velocity is speed in a specified direction
    3. Mean speed is [[{{: total distance :}|{: total time :}}]]
    4. Acceleration is the rate of change in speed
2. ###Graphs

    1. A distance/time graph is a graph of distance against time
    2. A speed/time graph is a graph of speed against time
    3. The speed/time graph of a body at rest is a flat line at zero
    4. The speed/time graph of a body moving with constant speed is a flat non-zero line
    5. The speed/time graph of a body moving with changing speed is a non-flat curve
    6. The speed/time graph of a body with constant acceleration is a linear graph with the gradient of the line equal to the acceleration
    6. The area under a speed/time graph is the distance travelled
3. ###Free fall

    1. Acceleration of free fall for a body near to the Earth is a constant 10 ms^^-2^^ [^g]
    2. Acceleration of free fall for a body in a uniform gravitational field is constant towards the centre of the field



[^g]: Acceleration is actually variable on the surface of Earth, but is always 9.8 ms^^-2^^ to 2 significant figures
