1. ###Definition

    1. Pressure is fore per area: [[p = {{: E :}|{: A :}}]]
2. ###Pressure below a liquid

    1. The pressure beneath a column of liquid is directly proportional to the density and depth of the liquid: [[p = hœÅg]]
3. ###Barometers

    1. Barometers can be used to measure atmospheric pressure
    2. A simple mercury barometer works by having a sealed tube of mercury sit upside-down in a reservoir of mercury; the mercury in the tube falls, creating a vacuum at the top, or rises until the pressure of the mercury matches atmospheric pressure
4. ###Manometers

    1. A manometer measures the pressure of a fluid, usually a gas
    2. It is a U-shaped tube containing a reference liquid, with one end open to the fluid whose pressure is to be obtained and the other open to a fluid with known concentration, such as the atmosphere; the difference in height of the two levels of liquid can be used to calculate the pressure of the unknown fluid, as the above equation reveals the pressure difference
