1. The approximate range of audible frequencies is 20-20,000 Hertz
2. The loudness of a sound rises with the amplitude of the sound wave
3. The pitch of a sound wave rises with the frequency of the sound wave
4. The reflection of sound produces an echo, which can be perceived if it returns with sufficient amplitude and volume
