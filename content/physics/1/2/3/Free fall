1. Acceleration of free fall for a body near to the Earth is a constant 10 ms^{-2} [^acceleration]
2. Acceleration of free fall for a body in a uniform gravitational field is constant towards the centre of the field



[^acceleration]: acceleration is actually variable on the surface of Earth, but is always 9.8 ms^-2 to 2 significant figures
