1. Length can be measured using a ruler, which typically has a precision of 10^^-3^^ m
2. A Vernier caliper has a precision of 10^^-4^^ m. The least significant figure is derived from which marking of the vernier scale, 9 gradations of 0.9 mm, is aligned with the millimetre reading
3. Micrometers are made even more precise by using a screw to amplify small distances
4. A zero error, the reading given at zero, must be subtracted from the measurement
