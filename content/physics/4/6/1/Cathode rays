1. Cathode rays are streams of electrons observed in vacuum tubes
2. At one end of a vacuum tube is a cathode, a thin wire filament through which is passed a high current, heating it so that electrons are released by thermionic emission and accelerated from the cathode towards an anode in the middle of the tube, resulting in a beam of electrons
3. The electrons travel in a straight line and hit the other end of the tube, causing the atoms they hit to glow with fluorescence
4. Since a cathode ray is a stream of electrons, it is deflected in the presence of an electric field
