1. A changing magnetic field can induce an e.m.f. in a circuit: pushing a bar magnet in or out of a coil or wire causes a current to flow, which can be detected using a galvanometer
2. The direction of an induced e.m.f. opposes the change causing it: if looking in the direction of the magnetic field, the induced current goes anti-clockwise
3. The magnitude of induction is directly proportional to the number of coils, the speed of motion and the strength of the magnet
