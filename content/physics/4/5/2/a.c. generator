1. In a magnetic field, rotating a coil such that the direction of the field, the axis of rotation and the direction of the coil are all perpendicular to one another induces in the coil an alternating current
2. Each end of the coil are connected to a slip ring, causing the coil to drive the connected circuit with an alternating current
3. The graph of voltage against number of rotations is a sinusoidal wave
