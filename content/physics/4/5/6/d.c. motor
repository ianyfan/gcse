1. In a magnetic field, a current-carrying coil pointing perpendicular to the direction of the field experiences a turning effect in which the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the direction of the field & coil
2. The magnitude of the turning effect is directly proportional to the magnitude of the current and the number of turns on the coil
3. This phenomenon can be utilised to create a motor, using slip rings or commutators to provide current from an a.c. or d.c. e.m.f. respectively; commutators are a set of contacts that touch the ends of motor, so that as the motor turns, the ends advance to a different contact and the current in the motor switches direction, allowing it to generate the correct torque to keep turning
