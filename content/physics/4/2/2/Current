1. Current is the flow of charge
2. [[I = {{Q}/{t}}]]
3. An ammeter is wired in series in a circuit to measure the current in that area
4. The direction of flow of electrons is the opposite of the flow of conventional current, since current is the flow of positive charge and electrons are negatively charged
