1. Damaged insulation exposes conducting wire to the air, which can cause a short-circuit if two exposed wires touch, or an electric shock if sufficient current contacts a human
2. Overheating of cables can cause the insulation to melt, releasing toxic fumes, or a fire
3. Damp conditions are dangerous because water is an electric conductor and touching an electrical appliance with wet hands can cause an electric shock
