1. Passing an electric current through a wire induces an electric current around the wire, which goes clockwise around it if looking in the direction of current
2. With multiple wires, the induced field superpose
3. In a solenoid, the resultant field goes straight through it (it effectively becomes a bar magnet) and if looking in its direction, the current goes clockwise
4. The strength of the magnetic field is inversely proportional to the distance from the wire and directly proportional to the magnitude of the current, the number of coils and the presence of an iron core
