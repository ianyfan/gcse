1. Resistance is potential difference divided by current
2. [[V = IR]]
3. The resistance of component can be obtained experimentally by wiring a voltmeter in parallel with it and an ammeter in series with it and dividing the measured voltage with the current
4. The resistance of a wire is directly proportional to its length and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area
