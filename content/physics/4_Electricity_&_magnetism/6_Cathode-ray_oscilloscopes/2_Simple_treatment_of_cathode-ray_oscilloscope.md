1. A cathode-ray oscilloscope uses a cathode ray to generate a beam of electrons that is observed on a screen
2. It has a deflection system of two plates that deflects the electrons when there is a potential difference between them
3. There are two deflections systems for each direction called the X-plates and the Y-plates
4. A deflection system can be wired to a circuit to show the potential difference between two points in the circuit
5. The X-plates is commonly wired to a time-base circuit in the oscilloscope to show how the potential difference in the circuit changes with time
