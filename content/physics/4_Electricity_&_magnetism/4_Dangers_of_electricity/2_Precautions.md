1. ###Fuses
 1. Fuses are thin wires that melt and break above a certain current, preventing the current getting too high in the circuit; fuses are contained in cartridges, making them easy to replace
 2. The fuse amperage required can be calculated from the power rating of the device and the mains voltage value of 230 V

2. ###Circuit breakers
 1. Circuit breakers are switches that turn off above a certain current and can be turned on again
 2. It consists of a switch and an electromagnet: when a large current flows through the circuit, the induced magnetism causes the switch to open, breaking the circuit
