1. Evaporation occurs when a more energetic molecule on the surface of the liquid overcomes the force of attraction from the other molecules and escapes 
2. Since the escaped molecule has a higher-than-average amount of energy, this lowers the average energy of the remaining molecules and therefore cools the liquid
3. Evaporation occurs faster with a higher temperature as the molecules have a higher mean kinetic energy and are therefore more likely to have enough energy to escape
4. Evaporation occurs faster with a larger surface area as there are more molecules exposed to the surface and it is therefore more likely that a molecule on the surface would be able to escape
5. Evaporation occurs faster with a faster draught since it maintains a partial pressure, which is the amount of water in the air, gradient; this is important as it shows the rate of water condensation, which reduces the net rate of evaporation
