1. The internal energy of a body is directly proportional to the temperature
2. Thermal capacity, otherwise known as specific heat capacity, is the amount of energy required to raise one kilogram of a substance by one kelvin
3. [[ΔE = SHC⋅m⋅ΔT]]
4. The specific heat capacity can be calculated by using a calorimeter to heat a mass of substance using a known amount of energy and using the change in temperature in the calculation
