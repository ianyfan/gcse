1. Because atoms move slightly, an increase of temperature makes them move more, resulting in an expansion
2. Gases expand more than liquids, which expand more than solids
3. An example of an everyday application is expansion joints, which prevent buckling
4. The volume of a gas is proportional to the temperature of the gas, at a constant pressure
