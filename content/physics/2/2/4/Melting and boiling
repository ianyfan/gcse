1. Melting & boiling are when a substance changes state from solid-to-liquid & liquid-to-gas respectivily with an input of energy without a change of temperature
2. The melting & boiling points are the points at which a substance changes state from solid-to-liquid & liquid-to-gas respectively
3. Evaporation is vaporisation on the surface of the liquid that can occur below the boiling point
4. Condensation & solidification are when a substance changes state from gas-to-liquid & liquid-to-solid and the reverse of evaporation & melting respectively
5. Latent heat is the energy change of a system without temperature change: the laten heat of vaporisation is the amount of energy required to boil a substance, and the latent heat of fusion is the amount of energy needed to melt a substance
6. There is an energy change without a temperature because the energy is from breaking or forming bonds between the molecules
7. The specific latent heat is the amount of energy required for one kilogram of a substance to change state; it can be measured in much the same way as the specific heat capacity
