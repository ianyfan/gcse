1. Radioactive particles can be measured using a Geiger counter, which counts the number of ionising events detected by a Geiger–Müller tube, which detects radioactive particles ionising an inert gas in it by passing a strong electric field through the gas that amplifies the signal of the radiation into an easily-measured pulse. When measuring levels of radioactivity, the base level of background radiation must be accounted for by being subtracted from the measurements
